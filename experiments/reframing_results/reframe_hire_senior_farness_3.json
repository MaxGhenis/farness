At a 15-person startup post-Series A, this means you likely won't have the person *contributing* for **7-9 months** (search + onboarding + learning context).\n- **The most common regret of Series A founders** (per First Round's State of Startups surveys) is \"hired too senior, too early.\" A VP Eng designed for a 50-person org often struggles to be effective at 15.\n- **CTO burnout is a real risk**: ~35% of technical co-founders report burnout as a primary factor in stepping back within 2 years of Series A (Startup Genome data).\n- **Engineering manager hires have significantly lower failure rates** (~20-25%) than VP-level hires because the role is more concrete, easier to evaluate, and less culturally disruptive.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Seniority bias / Silver bullet thinking** | \"If we just get a VP, everything gets fixed.\" The framing assumes a single senior hire resolves a systemic bottleneck. In reality, velocity bottlenecks are usually multi-causal (scope, tech debt, unclear priorities, hiring pipeline, process). |\n| **Anchoring on org chart convention** | \"We have a CTO, so the next hire should be a VP Eng.\" This is borrowed from companies 3-5x your size. At 15 people, you may not have enough direct reports to justify the layer. |\n| **Neglect of transition costs** | The question ignores the 6-9 month productivity dip during search + onboarding. During this period, the CTO is actually *more* burdened (interviewing, selling, onboarding). |\n| **Attribution error** | \"Engineering is the bottleneck\" \u2014 is it really? Or is it product direction churn, unclear priorities, or scope creep from founders? A VP Eng can't fix upstream problems. |\n| **Status quo bias (inverted)** | Post-fundraise, there's pressure to *spend* the money and visibly \"level up.\" This can drive premature hiring. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value Analysis)\n\n### Composite Expected Value Score (weighted: K1 = 40%, K2 = 35%, K3 = 25%)\n\nNormalizing costs inversely and weighting:\n\n| Option | EV Score | Risk-Adjusted Rank |\n|--------|----------|-------------------|\n| **C: 1-2 Eng Managers** | **Highest** | **#1** |\n| A: VP Eng | Medium-High (but high variance) | #3 |\n| D: Fractional VP | Medium | #2 (as complement) |\n| B: Internal promote | Medium | #4 |\n| E: Fix process | Medium-Low | #5 (but should be done regardless) |\n| F: Do nothing | Low | #6 |\n\n---\n\n### **Primary Recommendation: Option C + E (with D as optional accelerant)**\n\n**Hire 1-2 strong engineering managers now. Simultaneously invest in process improvements. Optionally bring in a fractional VP Eng for 3 months to help design the org and coach the new managers.**\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Speed to impact.** Eng managers can be hired in 4-8 weeks vs. 4-6 months for a VP. At your stage, *time is the most expensive resource.*\n\n2. **Lower failure rate.** ~20-25% vs. ~40-60%. A bad VP Eng hire at 15 people is *catastrophic* \u2014 it can cause your best engineers to leave.\n\n3. **Right-sized for 15 people.** You likely have 8-12 engineers. That's 1-2 teams. You need team leads, not a VP. A VP Eng becomes the right hire at ~25-40 engineers.\n\n4. **Preserves the VP Eng option.** In 12 months, when you're 25-30 people, you'll have better signal on what kind of VP you actually need \u2014 and the eng managers you hired now will make that VP *more effective* on day one.\n\n5. **Addresses CTO leverage directly.** Two eng managers reporting to the CTO takes 60-70% of management burden off immediately while keeping the CTO in a position to set technical direction.\n\n### **Explicit trigger to revisit Option A:**\nWhen the engineering team exceeds **20-25 people** OR when you have **3+ engineering managers** who need coordination beyond what the CTO can provide.\n\n---\n\n### Key Risk to Monitor\nIf you cannot identify a strong internal candidate AND the eng manager pipeline is thin in your market, Option D (fractional VP) becomes the critical bridge. Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good \u2014 the real enemy is the status quo eroding your CTO's effectiveness month by month.",
