  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Framework\n\nThis is a big decision, so let me help you think through it honestly rather than just give a simple yes/no.\n\n## The Raw Financial Math\n\n**Costs (over 2 years):**\n- Tuition: ~$160K\n- Lost wages: ~$260K (2 years of salary)\n- **Total real cost: ~$420K**\n\nThat's a steep hill to climb back.\n\n## The Honest Questions That Actually Matter\n\n**1. What do you want the MBA *for*?**\nThis is the single most important question. An MBA makes strong sense for:\n- Career **switching** (into management consulting, finance, product management, corporate strategy)\n- Breaking into senior leadership at large companies\n- Building a network in a specific industry\n\nIt makes **weak** sense for:\n- Vaguely \"leveling up\"\n- Staying in software engineering\n- A credential for its own sake\n\n**2. What does \"good\" program mean?**\nThis matters enormously. The ROI difference between a top-15 and a top-50 program is massive. M7 programs (Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, etc.) offer network effects that practically guarantee ROI. Outside the top 20-25, the math gets much harder.\n\n**3. Have you hit a real ceiling?**\nAt 3 years in, honestly... probably not yet. Many engineers reach $200-300K+ at senior/staff levels without an MBA. If you're at a FAANG or similar, the pure engineering track may outpace the MBA financially for years.\n\n## My Honest Take\n\n**I'd lean toward \"not yet\" unless:**\n- \u2705 It's a **top 15 program** (ideally top 10)\n- \u2705 You have a **specific career goal** the MBA directly enables\n- \u2705 You've genuinely explored whether that goal is reachable without the MBA\n- \u2705 You're energized by the *direction change*, not just escaping something\n\n**Consider waiting if:**\n- You're mainly feeling restless at the 3-year mark (normal)\n- You can't articulate what post-MBA role you want\n- You haven't yet maximized your engineering compensation trajectory\n\n## What I'd Actually Recommend\n\nBefore deciding, do these three things:\n\n1. **Talk to 5-10 alumni** from that specific program who had your background. Where are they now? Was it worth it?\n2. **Research your target post-MBA roles** \u2014 what do they actually pay in years 1-5? Model the real breakeven point.\n3. **Explore the alternative path** \u2014 could you move into product management or engineering leadership without the MBA?\n\nThe MBA can be a genuinely great investment, but only when it's a **bridge to something specific**, not a detour taken out of uncertainty.\n\nWhat's the program, and what are you hoping to do afterward? That would help me give sharper advice.",
