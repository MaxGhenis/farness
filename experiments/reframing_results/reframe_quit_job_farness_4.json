Stay | **$1,550K** | $1,350\u20131,800K | Stable comp with ~5-8% annual increases, RSU refreshers |\n| B. Quit now | **$450K** | \u2212$150K \u2013 $2,500K | ~$0 salary Y1-2, burning savings; massive upside tail but low probability |\n| C. Reduced hours | **$1,250K** | $1,050\u20131,550K | ~80% salary + option to capture startup upside if validated |\n| D. Leave of absence | **$1,350K** | $900\u20131,700K | Brief salary gap, preserves return option |\n| E. Co-founder builds | **$1,400K** | $1,000\u20132,200K | Keep salary, give up equity share; startup has builder from day 1 |\n| F. Raise then quit | **$700K** | $100\u20132,800K | Delayed salary loss, higher startup survival rate with more runway |\n\n### KPI 2 \u2014 Career Capital (1-100)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A. Stay | **65** | 55\u201375 |\n| B. Quit now | **70** | 35\u201390 |\n| C. Reduced hours | **68** | 55\u201380 |\n| D. Leave of absence | **67** | 55\u201380 |\n| E. Co-founder builds | **72** | 55\u201385 |\n| F. Raise then quit | **74** | 40\u201390 |\n\n*Startup experience is high-variance: extraordinary if it works, modest if it fails quickly.*\n\n### KPI 3 \u2014 Life Satisfaction (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A. Stay | **5.5** | 4\u20137 |\n| B. Quit now | **6.0** | 3\u20138.5 |\n| C. Reduced hours | **7.0** | 5.5\u20138.5 |\n| D. Leave of absence | **6.5** | 5\u20138 |\n| E. Co-founder builds | **6.5** | 4.5\u20138 |\n| F. Raise then quit | **6.5** | 4\u20138.5 |\n\n*Note: B's low end (3) reflects the documented stress of burning personal savings with a toddler and no revenue.*\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Data Point | Source/Estimate |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Startup failure rate** | ~90% of startups fail; ~75% of VC-backed startups return less than invested capital (Cambridge Associates) |\n| **Developer tools specifically** | Crowded market; ~1 in 15-20 dev-tools startups reach $10M ARR (Heavybit data) |\n| **Solo founder success** | Solo founders take ~3.6x longer to reach scale vs. teams of 2-3 (Startup Genome) |\n| **Self-funded survival** | $200K runway at reasonable burn (~$10K/mo living + $3K infra) = ~15 months before personal financial stress |\n| **Google PM return rate** | Anecdotally high \u2014 ex-Google PMs re-hired or hired at peer companies within 3-6 months (strong safety net) |\n| **Passion as predictor** | Passion correlates with persistence but NOT with market fit; \"passion bias\" is documented in entrepreneurship research (Cardon et al., 2009) |\n| **Age/stage penalty** | Founders with children report 2x stress levels; however, median successful founder age is ~42 (Kellogg/MIT study), so age is actually favorable |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **False binary framing** | The question is \"quit or stay\" \u2014 ignoring C, D, E, F which may dominate both |\n| **Passion bias / Affect heuristic** | \"I'm passionate about\" is doing heavy lifting; passion feels like evidence of quality but isn't |\n| **Opportunity cost neglect** | Focus on startup upside without viscerally weighting $350K/yr foregone (~$1K/day) |\n| **Survivorship bias** | You're likely anchoring on visible dev-tools successes (Stripe, Vercel, etc.), not the hundreds of dead competitors |\n| **Status quo bias (counter)** | Interestingly, in startup culture, there's an *anti*-status-quo bias \u2014 quitting is romanticized, staying is stigmatized as cowardly |\n| **Overconfidence in idea stage** | No mention of customers, waitlist, LOIs, or revenue \u2014 the idea is currently at maximum uncertainty |\n| **Endowment effect on savings** | $200K feels like \"a lot\" but is only ~7 months of your current compensation |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value)\n\n### Composite Ranking\n\nWeighting KPIs at 40% Financial / 25% Career Capital / 35% Life Satisfaction (reflecting your life stage):\n\n| Option | Weighted Score | Risk Profile |\n|--------|---------------|-------------|\n| **C. Reduced hours + validate** | **\u2605 Highest** | Low downside |\n| **E. Co-founder builds** | **\u2605\u2605 Close second** | Moderate |\n| D. Leave of absence | Good | Low-moderate |\n| F. Raise then quit | Good if possible | Moderate |\n| A. Stay (status quo) | Acceptable | Lowest |\n| **B. Quit now** | **Lowest risk-adjusted** | **Highest variance** |\n\n---\n\n### My Recommendation: **Option C \u2192 B (Staged Approach)**\n\n> **Do not quit today. Instead:**\n>\n> 1. **Months 1-3:** Negotiate 80% time or shift to a less demanding role at Google. Spend nights/Fridays doing customer discovery \u2014 talk to 50+ developers, validate willingness to pay. Build an MVP or clickable prototype.\n>\n> 2. **Month 3-6:** If you have \u22655 design partners or $2K+ MRR in LOIs/pilots, begin fundraising or recruit a technical co-founder. If you don't, the idea likely needs pivoting (which is cheaper to do while employed).\n>\n> 3. **Month 6:** If signal is strong \u2192 quit with conviction, external validation, and possibly external funding (preserving your $200K as family safety net, not burn). If signal is weak \u2192 you saved your family $175K+ in foregone salary and you still have your idea pipeline.\n\n### Why NOT Option B (quit now):\n\n- The expected value of B is **not bad** \u2014 it's the **variance** that's the problem given your life stage. With a 2-year-old and a working spouse, the downside scenarios (burn savings, 18 months of stress, return to employment with depleted finances and a gap) are disproportionately painful.\n- You have **zero mentioned validation** \u2014 no customers, no revenue, no waitlist. Quitting to find product-market-fit is the most expensive possible way to do customer discovery.\n- Your Google PM salary is not just income \u2014 it's **free optionality**. Every month employed is a free option on your startup that costs you only the time-delay (which, at idea stage, has negligible cost).\n\n### The key insight:\n\n**The value of information from 3 months of validation while employed is worth far more than the 3 months of speed you gain by quitting now.** The startup will not die because you started it 3 months later. But your financial resilience and decision quality will be materially better.\n\n---\n\n*Bottom line: Your passion is a feature, not a strategy. Convert it into evidence first, then make the leap with conviction instead of hope.*",
