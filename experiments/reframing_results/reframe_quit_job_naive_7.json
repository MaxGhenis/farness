  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your Startup Decision\n\nThis is a significant decision, so I want to be genuinely helpful rather than just cheerleading or fear-mongering. Let me lay out how I'd think about it honestly.\n\n## What's actually at stake financially\n\n- You're giving up **~$350K/year** (likely more with equity vesting)\n- $200K in savings sounds like a lot, but with a family in a GOOG-cost-of-living area, that might be **8-12 months of runway** depending on your burn rate\n- Your spouse's income is a critical variable you haven't specified\n\n**Do the math concretely:** What are your actual monthly expenses? How many months can you survive on one income + savings without lifestyle changes? That number is your real runway.\n\n## Things that favor going for it\n\n- You have a working spouse (partial safety net)\n- Developer tools is a domain where **your Google PM credibility is a real asset** \u2014 for fundraising, hiring, and customer trust\n- PM skills at Google-scale are directly transferable to building dev tools\n- Age of your child: 2 is actually easier than 7-12 in some ways (they won't remember this period)\n- Passion matters \u2014 if you're going to do this ever, the cost only grows with time, more kids, bigger lifestyle\n\n## Things that give me pause\n\n- **$200K is thin** for a family with a toddler if you're not raising capital quickly\n- Developer tools is a space with **real revenue challenges** \u2014 long sales cycles, developers resist paying, enterprise sales require a team\n- You said \"idea\" \u2014 not \"I have design partners\" or \"I've validated demand.\" That's a big gap.\n- The Google opportunity cost compounds: unvested RSUs, promotions, network effects\n- Startup stress + toddler + financial pressure is genuinely hard on marriages\n\n## My honest recommendation\n\n**Don't quit yet. But set a concrete 3-month plan to earn the right to quit.**\n\nHere's why and how:\n\n### Phase 1 \u2014 Validate before you leap (next 2-3 months, nights/weekends)\n- Talk to 30+ potential users/customers. Not \"would you use this?\" but \"tell me about this problem\"\n- Build a rough prototype or even just a detailed mockup\n- Test willingness to pay with concrete pricing conversations\n- If dev tools \u2014 can you get 5 people to use a janky MVP?\n\n### Phase 2 \u2014 Define your quit criteria in advance\nWrite down specifically what would make you quit. For example:\n- \"If 10 developers sign up for a waitlist AND 3 say they'd pay $X/month AND my spouse and I agree on Y months of runway\"\n- Having pre-committed criteria prevents both endless delay AND reckless leaps\n\n### Phase 3 \u2014 Consider the middle paths\n- Could you take a less demanding role at Google or go part-time while testing this?\n- Could you raise a small pre-seed round before quitting, based on your background? (A Google PM with a validated dev tools idea can likely raise $500K-$1M on relatively little proof)\n- Could you take a leave of absence?\n\n## The deeper question\n\nThere are two versions of regret to weigh:\n\n1. **\"I never tried\"** \u2014 this compounds over a lifetime\n2. **\"I blew up my family's financial stability on an unvalidated idea\"** \u2014 this also compounds\n\nThe goal isn't to eliminate risk. It's to **take the right risks at the right time with the right information.** Right now you're at the \"passionate idea\" stage. Get to the \"validated opportunity\" stage first, and the decision becomes much clearer.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Your profile is strong for eventually doing this. But \"I have an idea I'm passionate about\" is not yet sufficient reason to walk away from $350K with a toddler. Do 2-3 months of serious validation work. If the signal is strong, then leap \u2014 and you'll leap with more conviction, a better pitch to investors, and less financial terror.\n\nWhat's the actual idea? I might be able to pressure-test the validation approach more specifically.",
