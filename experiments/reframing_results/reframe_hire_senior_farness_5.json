External VPE | **+40%** | +10% to +70% | Wide range because mis-hires are common; when it works, transformational |\n| B. Internal promote | **+20%** | +5% to +35% | Lower ceiling but much tighter distribution; less disruption |\n| C. Fractional VPE | **+25%** | +10% to +45% | Faster to engage; limited by part-time hours and cultural buy-in |\n| D. Senior ICs + PM | **+30%** | +15% to +50% | Directly adds throughput; PM offloads coordination from CTO |\n| E. Outsourced squad | **+15%** | \u22125% to +35% | Integration overhead often eats gains; negative scenario = net drag |\n| F. Status quo | **0%** | \u221215% to +5% | Likely continues to degrade as complexity grows |\n\n### KPI 2 \u2014 Time-to-Productive-Impact (months)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|:-:|:-:|\n| A. External VPE | **5 months** | 3\u20139 |\n| B. Internal promote | **2 months** | 1\u20134 |\n| C. Fractional VPE | **1.5 months** | 1\u20133 |\n| D. Senior ICs + PM | **4 months** | 3\u20136 |\n| E. Outsourced squad | **3 months** | 2\u20136 |\n| F. Status quo | **0** | 0 |\n\n### KPI 3 \u2014 12-Month Fully-Loaded Cost ($)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Notes |\n|--------|:-:|:-:|-------|\n| A. External VPE | **$350K\u2013$450K** | $300K\u2013$550K | Salary + equity + recruiter fee (20-25% of Y1) |\n| B. Internal promote | **$40K\u2013$80K** | $30K\u2013$100K | Raise + equity top-up + coaching/training budget |\n| C. Fractional VPE | **$120K\u2013$180K** | $90K\u2013$220K | Typically $2K\u2013$4K/day, 2-3 days/week |\n| D. Senior ICs + PM | **$500K\u2013$650K** | $400K\u2013$750K | 2 senior devs + 1 PM; higher direct cost but additive capacity |\n| E. Outsourced squad | **$300K\u2013$500K** | $250K\u2013$600K | 3-4 person squad at $50-60/hr blended |\n| F. Status quo | **$0 incremental** | \u2014 | But implicit cost of missed milestones and founder burnout |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **VPE mis-hire rate at startups <50 people:** ~40-50% churn within 18 months (based on data from First Round Capital's State of Startups surveys and general executive recruiting benchmarks). The \"CTO who hasn't managed managers before hires a VPE who hasn't operated at this stage before\" pairing is particularly failure-prone.\n- **Median time to fill a VPE role:** 4-6 months (Lever/Greenhouse benchmarks for senior roles), meaning you may not even have someone starting for **3-5 months**.\n- **Series A median runway:** ~18-24 months. Five months of delay is **20-25% of your execution window** before you need to show Series B metrics.\n- **Fractional executive engagement success rate:** ~65-70% report meaningful improvement within 90 days (based on data from fractional exec platforms like Bolster and The Finery).\n- **Internal promotions for engineering leadership:** Higher 2-year retention (~75%) vs. external hires (~50-55%) at early-stage companies (multiple studies on promote-vs-hire).\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Shows Up Here |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Solutionism / Narrow Framing** | The question is framed as \"Should we hire a VPE \u2014 yes or no?\" This binary hides at least 4 other viable options. |\n| **Title Inflation Bias** | \"VP of Engineering\" sounds like the right answer because it's the canonical Silicon Valley playbook. But a 15-person company may not need (or be able to attract) a true VPE \u2014 you may need a **senior engineering manager**. |\n| **Fundamental Attribution Error** | \"Engineering is our bottleneck\" may misattribute a **process/prioritization problem** to a **people/capacity problem**. Is the CTO overwhelmed because of management load, or because of unclear product requirements, shifting priorities, or technical debt? A VPE won't fix the latter. |\n| **Anchoring on the CTO's self-diagnosis** | CTOs often say \"I need a VPE so I can focus on architecture\" when what they actually need is to **stop doing architecture and start leading engineering** \u2014 or vice versa. The framing accepts the CTO's role preference without examining whether it's correct for the company stage. |\n| **Survivorship Bias** | You've heard stories of companies where a great VPE hire unlocked everything. You haven't heard about the majority of cases where it didn't work, because those companies don't write blog posts about it. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value)\n\n### Primary Recommendation: **Option C \u2192 A (Staged Approach)**\n\n**Start with a fractional/interim VPE (Option C) immediately, with an explicit 90-day mandate**, then transition to a full-time hire (Option A or B) once you've learned what you actually need.\n\n**Rationale using expected value:**\n\n**Calculating risk-adjusted velocity gain per dollar:**\n\n| Option | E[Velocity Gain] | E[Cost] | E[Time to Impact] | Risk-Adjusted Value |\n|--------|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| A (External VPE direct) | +40% \u00d7 ~55% success = **+22% effective** | ~$400K + $80K recruiter | 5 months | Moderate |\n| C \u2192 A (Staged) | +25% in months 1-4, then +40% \u00d7 ~70% success* = **+28% effective** | ~$150K + $400K | 1.5 months | **Highest** |\n| D (Senior ICs + PM) | +30% \u00d7 ~75% success = **+22.5% effective** | ~$575K | 4 months | Comparable but higher burn |\n\n*The success rate for the permanent hire jumps from ~55% to ~70% because the fractional VPE helps you define the role, assess the CTO's actual gaps, and potentially even source the full-time hire.*\n\n### Why this wins:\n\n1. **Speed**: You get impact in weeks, not months. At your runway stage, speed is everything.\n2. **Reduces mis-hire risk**: The #1 failure mode (bad VPE hire at $400K+) is substantially mitigated because you learn what you actually need before committing.\n3. **Tests the hypothesis**: Maybe the real answer is Option B or Option D. The fractional VPE can diagnose this for you.\n4. **Preserves optionality**: You're not locked into a $400K+/year commitment before you understand the real problem.\n\n### Concrete Next Steps:\n\n1. **This week**: Have a brutally honest conversation with the CTO. What specifically is overwhelming them \u2014 people management? Technical decisions? Stakeholder management? Sprint planning? The answer reshapes everything.\n2. **Within 2 weeks**: Engage a fractional VPE (platforms: Bolster, The Finery, or your investors' talent network) with a 90-day scope: assess team health, install basic engineering management practices, and produce a written recommendation for the permanent role.\n3. **In parallel**: Begin a *quiet* search for a full-time hire, informed by what you learn in the first 60 days. This search takes months anyway \u2014 you lose nothing by starting it alongside the fractional engagement.\n4. **At day 90**: Make the permanent decision with actual data instead of assumptions.\n\n### The one thing I'd insist you investigate first:\n\nBefore any of this, spend one week tracking **why** things aren't shipping. If the answer is \"unclear requirements from product\" or \"too many priority changes from founders,\" a VPE will not fix your problem \u2014 and you'll waste six months discovering that.",
