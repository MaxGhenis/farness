Discounted at 8%.*\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Key Assumptions |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n| **A \u2014 Stay** | $1,450K | ($1,200K \u2013 $1,700K) | Promotions, RSU refreshes; low variance |\n| **B \u2014 Quit now** | $550K | (\u2212$100K \u2013 $2,500K) | Median startup = $0 exit; small chance of large outcome; spouse income ~$100-150K covers basics |\n| **C \u2014 LOA** | $1,100K | ($700K \u2013 $1,800K) | Reduced salary period, but safety net; startup upside partially captured |\n| **D \u2014 Moonlight \u2192 milestone quit** | $1,050K | ($600K \u2013 $2,200K) | 6-9 months slower start, but filters out bad ideas before you pay the full opportunity cost |\n| **E \u2014 Raise then quit** | $750K | ($200K \u2013 $2,800K) | Dilution reduces your % but increases probability of funded runway; ~40% chance you fail to raise and stay at Google |\n\n### KPI 2: Career Capital at T+5 (proxied by best available comp, $000s)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A \u2014 Stay** | $450K | ($380K \u2013 $550K) |\n| **B \u2014 Quit now** | $400K | ($250K \u2013 $900K) |\n| **C \u2014 LOA** | $430K | ($350K \u2013 $600K) |\n| **D \u2014 Moonlight \u2192 quit** | $420K | ($340K \u2013 $700K) |\n| **E \u2014 Raise then quit** | $420K | ($280K \u2013 $850K) |\n\n*Note: Founder experience at a funded startup is valued even if it fails. But a 2-year resume gap with nothing shipped is penalized.*\n\n### KPI 3: Average Life Satisfaction (1\u201310)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A \u2014 Stay** | 6.0 | (5.0 \u2013 7.0) |\n| **B \u2014 Quit now** | 6.5 | (3.5 \u2013 8.5) |\n| **C \u2014 LOA** | 6.8 | (5.5 \u2013 8.0) |\n| **D \u2014 Moonlight \u2192 quit** | 6.5 | (5.0 \u2013 8.0) |\n| **E \u2014 Raise then quit** | 6.3 | (4.5 \u2013 8.0) |\n\n*Option B has the widest variance: the autonomy high is real, but financial stress with a 2-year-old and a burning savings account is brutal. The median founder reports high stress and lower well-being than expected (Harvard Business Review founder well-being study, 2023).*\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Statistic | Source / Basis |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **~90% of startups fail** (return < capital invested) | CB Insights, Startup Genome |\n| **Median time-to-revenue for dev tools: 12-18 months** | OpenView Partners DevTool benchmarks |\n| **Solo founders succeed ~half as often** as teams of 2-3 | Startup Genome Project |\n| **~60% of \"passionate\" startup ideas** by first-time founders pivot substantially within year 1 | Y Combinator partner anecdotes; First Round Capital data |\n| **Boomerang rate**: ~50-70% of FAANG departures in PM can return within 2 years at similar comp | Levels.fyi anecdotal; LinkedIn data |\n| **Moonlighting validation**: Founders who validate pre-quit are **2-3x more likely** to reach Series A | Indie Hackers survey data; not rigorous but directionally useful |\n| **Developer tools median seed round (2024)**: $3-4M at $15-20M post-money | PitchBook |\n| **Probability of a Google PM raising a seed**: ~30-50% with idea + some traction; ~10-15% with idea alone | VC conversion rate data (Carta) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Passion bias / Affect heuristic** | \"I'm passionate about\" is doing heavy emotional lifting. Passion is necessary but has near-zero predictive power for startup success. The question frames this as a binary heart-vs-head decision. |\n| **Omission of alternatives** | Framed as \"quit or don't quit\" \u2014 a classic false binary. Options C, D, and E are invisible in the original framing. |\n| **Sunk cost / identity** | $350K comp is anchoring you to the pain of \"giving this up.\" But the real question is forward-looking expected value, not what you're leaving. |\n| **Survivorship bias** | Your mental model of \"startup founder\" is shaped by the visible winners. The 90% who failed are invisible. |\n| **Present bias** | The excitement of quitting is vivid and immediate. The compounding cost of foregone RSU vesting and 401(k) match over 5 years is abstract. |\n| **Optimism bias** | First-time founders overestimate their probability of success by 2-4x (Cooper, Woo & Dunkelberg, 1988 \u2014 still replicated). You likely think your odds are ~30-40%. Base rate says ~10%. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Don't take Option B. Pursue Option D (Moonlight \u2192 Milestone-Triggered Quit).\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n**1. The expected financial value of quitting now (B) is ~$900K lower than staying (A), and the downside scenario with a toddler and $200K in savings is genuinely painful.** Your savings gives you ~12-18 months of runway assuming spouse income covers ~60% of expenses. That is tight for a dev tools company that likely needs 12-18 months to first revenue.\n\n**2. Option D captures 70-80% of the upside of quitting while eliminating the worst downside scenarios.** You:\n- Validate demand before paying full opportunity cost\n- Build in public, ship an MVP, talk to 50+ developers\n- Set an explicit, non-negotiable trigger: *\"I quit when I hit [specific milestone]\"*\n- Preserve Google income during the highest-risk phase (pre-PMF)\n\n**3. Concrete trigger examples** (hit ANY one within 9 months):\n- $3K MRR from paying users\n- Signed seed term sheet \u2265 $2M\n- 500 weekly active users with >40% W1 retention\n- A credible co-founder joins full-time\n\n**4. If you hit no trigger in 9 months, that is extremely valuable information.** You've spent ~$0 in savings and learned your idea needs a major pivot or isn't viable. You can try again.\n\n**5. The \"but I can't do a startup part-time\" objection is partially valid but overstated for dev tools.** You don't need to out-execute a funded team in month 1. You need to validate that developers want this. That's 15-20 hours/week of building and talking to users. Many successful dev tool companies (Vercel, Railway, Linear) had significant pre-launch moonlighting phases.\n\n### If you are psychologically incapable of Option D:\nChoose **Option E** (raise first, then quit). Your Google PM title is a depreciating asset for fundraising \u2014 use it while you have it. A $3M seed gives you 18-24 months of runway and eliminates the scenario where you burn your family's savings to zero.\n\n### Decision hygiene commitment:\nWrite down today: *\"If by [date 9 months out] I have not hit [specific trigger], I will stop and re-evaluate with fresh eyes, not extend the timeline.\"* Share it with your spouse. **Pre-commitment is the antidote to escalation of commitment**, which kills more founder careers than bad ideas do.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Your instinct to build is probably right. Your instinct to quit *now* is probably premature. Sequence the risk. Validate, then leap.",
