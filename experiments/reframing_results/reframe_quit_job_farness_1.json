Range reflects promo vs. layoff risk. |\n| **B: Bootstrap** | **\u2212$50K** | [\u2212$400K, +$3,000K] | Median startup fails; you burn $150-200K and return to market. But 5-8% chance of $5M+ outcome skews the mean up. |\n| **C: Raise seed** | **+$50K** | [\u2212$300K, +$5,000K] | Salary partially restored (~$120K), dilution reduces upside ceiling slightly, but survival rate improves. |\n| **D: Moonlight** | **+$900K** | [$500K, $1,500K] | Keep Google income 6-12 months. If validation fails, you lost nothing. If it works, transition to B or C with dramatically reduced risk. |\n| **E: Internal** | **+$1,100K** | [$800K, $1,500K] | Similar comp, some entrepreneurial exposure, but capped upside. |\n| **F: Co-founder first** | **+$100K** | [\u2212$350K, +$4,000K] | Solo dev-tools founders have ~40% lower success rates than teams. Finding a co-founder significantly shifts the distribution. |\n\n### Career Capital (0-100)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A: Stay | 55 | [45, 70] |\n| B: Bootstrap | 75 | [50, 90] |\n| C: Raise seed | 80 | [55, 92] |\n| D: Moonlight | 65 | [55, 78] |\n| E: Internal | 60 | [50, 72] |\n| F: Co-founder first | 82 | [60, 93] |\n\n*Startup experience \u2014 even failed \u2014 is highly valued in PM careers. But only if you actually ship and learn.*\n\n### Life Satisfaction (0-100)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A: Stay | 55 | [40, 68] |\n| B: Bootstrap | 55 | [25, 85] |\n| C: Raise seed | 58 | [30, 80] |\n| D: Moonlight | 50 | [35, 62] |\n| E: Internal | 58 | [45, 70] |\n| F: Co-founder first | 60 | [30, 82] |\n\n*Note the extreme variance in B. Financial stress + toddler + startup = potential marital strain. But passion + autonomy = potential joy. The 2-year-old makes the downside more painful than for a single 25-year-old.*\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Statistic | Source/Estimate |\n|-----------|----------------|\n| **Startup failure rate (seed-stage)** | ~60-70% fail to return 1\u00d7 capital within 5 years (CB Insights, Crunchbase) |\n| **Solo founder success rate** | ~50% lower than 2-3 person founding teams (MIT study, Noam Wasserman data) |\n| **Developer tools VC success** | Dev tools have ~15-20% Series A conversion rate from seed; slightly above SaaS median but monetization is notoriously hard (many devs expect free tools) |\n| **Google PM re-hire rate** | Former Google PMs typically land $250K+ roles within 3-6 months if startup fails \u2014 your downside floor is real but time-limited |\n| **Startup founder median age** | ~42 for successful founders (Kellogg/MIT study) \u2014 you're likely not \"too late\" |\n| **Savings runway** | $200K \u00f7 ~$12K/mo burn (Bay Area family, reduced spending) = ~16 months. With spouse income, possibly 20-24 months. Tight but viable. |\n| **Moonlighting-to-startup conversion** | Founders who validate with customers before quitting have ~2\u00d7 higher 3-year survival rates (various YC partner anecdotes, Indie Hackers data) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **False binary / narrow framing** | \"Should I quit or not\" ignores Options D, E, F. This is the most common bias in career decisions. |\n| **Passion bias / affect heuristic** | \"I'm passionate about\" signals you may be weighting emotional pull over market evidence. Passion is necessary but not sufficient. Have you talked to 30 target users? |\n| **Status quo bias (counter-pressure)** | Google golden handcuffs create inertia. $350K feels like a lot to walk away from \u2014 but the opportunity cost framing cuts both ways. |\n| **Survivorship bias** | You're probably mentally modeling successful dev tools founders (Guillermo Rauch, Mitchell Hashimoto). You're not modeling the thousands who failed silently. |\n| **Sunk cost of ideation** | Time spent thinking about the idea may make you feel committed before validation. |\n| **Neglect of family tail risk** | The framing mentions spouse and child almost as an aside. Financial stress is the #1 predictor of marital conflict. This deserves explicit scenario planning, not a footnote. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### **Recommended: Option D \u2192 F \u2192 C (Staged approach)**\n\n**Phase 1 (Months 1-6): Moonlight aggressively**\n- Build an MVP on evenings/weekends (yes, it's brutal with a toddler \u2014 scope it to 10 hrs/week)\n- Talk to 30+ developers. Get 5 design partners using the tool weekly.\n- Begin co-founder search in parallel\n\n**Decision gate:** Do you have \u22653 teams using the tool regularly AND a co-founder candidate?\n\n**Phase 2 (Months 6-9): If gate passes \u2192 Leave and raise**\n- You now have traction, a co-founder, and a story \u2014 your seed round will be dramatically better\n- Your $200K stays mostly intact as a family safety net rather than your runway\n\n**Phase 3: If gate fails \u2192 Stay, iterate, or move on**\n- You preserved $1M+ in expected income and learned cheaply\n- Your career capital still increased\n\n### Why this dominates Option B (quit now):\n\n| Factor | Quit Now (B) | Staged (D\u2192F\u2192C) |\n|--------|-------------|-----------------|\n| Expected financial value | \u2212$50K | +$400K to +$900K |\n| Information gained before burning bridges | None | Massive |\n| Risk to family stability | High | Low-Medium |\n| Quality of fundraise | Pitch deck only | Traction + co-founder |\n| Probability of eventual startup success | ~15% | ~25-30% |\n\n### The key insight:\n**The value of information from 6 months of moonlighting is worth far more than 6 months of runway.** You're not choosing between \"passion vs. safety\" \u2014 you're choosing between *an uninformed leap* and *a validated leap*. The validated leap has higher expected value on **every** KPI.\n\n### One exception where you should quit now:\nIf the market window is genuinely closing (e.g., an AI moment where 6 months of delay means 10 funded competitors), the option value of speed may dominate. But dev tools rarely have 6-month windows \u2014 they reward depth and trust.\n\n---\n\n*\"The best founders aren't the ones who quit fastest. They're the ones who de-risk fastest.\"*",
