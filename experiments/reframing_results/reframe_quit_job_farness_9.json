  "response_text": "# Decision Analysis: Leave Google for Developer Tools Startup\n\n## Step 1: Define Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **Expected Financial Outcome (EFO)** | Net change in household wealth over 5 years (salary + equity outcomes - costs) | 5 years |\n| **Career Capital** | Optionality-weighted value of skills, network, and reputational assets at T+5 | 5 years |\n| **Life Satisfaction / Regret Minimization** | Subjective well-being score (1-10) weighted by probability of each scenario | Ongoing |\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Identify Options (Expanding the Frame)\n\n| # | Option |\n|---|--------|\n| A | **Quit now, go full-time on startup** |\n| B | **Moonlight for 6-12 months**, validate demand, then decide |\n| C | **Take an internal transfer** to a more entrepreneurial role (Area 120 equivalent, or a smaller team) to scratch the itch |\n| D | **Recruit a co-founder to start building** while you stay employed, then join at a milestone trigger |\n| E | **Stay at Google**, invest the $200K as an angel in dev-tools startups |\n| F | **Negotiate a leave of absence** (Google has done these); gives a reversible off-ramp |\n\n> *Framing bias detected immediately: the question was binary (quit vs. stay). Options B, D, and F are often superior and were not mentioned.*\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Point Estimates and 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### 3a. Expected Financial Outcome (5-Year \u0394 Household Wealth)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Key Assumptions |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n| **A. Quit now** | **-$150K** | (-$900K, +$3M) | Burn ~$150-250K over 2 yrs; 90% chance of $0 equity outcome, ~7% modest exit, ~3% big outcome |\n| **B. Moonlight 6-12 mo** | **+$250K** | (-$400K, +$3M) | Keep salary during validation; if you quit, you quit with signal \u2192 better fundraising |\n| **C. Internal transfer** | **+$500K** | (+$200K, +$900K) | Continued comp growth, RSU vesting |\n| **D. Co-founder builds, you join at milestone** | **+$50K** | (-$600K, +$3.5M) | Delayed salary loss; but co-founder may take more equity |\n| **E. Stay + angel invest** | **+$550K** | (+$100K, +$1.2M) | Best financial base case; angel portfolio expected value ~1x at median |\n| **F. Leave of absence** | **+$100K** | (-$500K, +$3M) | Similar to A but with a safety net; slightly less upside if you hedge psychologically |\n\n### 3b. Career Capital (1-10 scale at T+5)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Notes |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-------|\n| A | 7.5 | (5, 9) | Founding experience is high-signal even if startup fails; but 2-year gap risk |\n| B | 7.0 | (6, 9) | Slightly less committed signal, but de-risked |\n| C | 6.5 | (5.5, 7.5) | Incremental growth, diminishing returns on \"Google PM\" brand |\n| D | 7.5 | (6, 9) | Best of both: you join with traction story |\n| E | 6.0 | (5, 7) | Stagnation risk; \"lifer\" narrative |\n| F | 7.5 | (6, 9) | Similar to A with reversibility |\n\n### 3c. Life Satisfaction / Regret Minimization (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Notes |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-------|\n| A | 7.0 | (4, 9) | High variance \u2014 exhilarating or devastating with a toddler |\n| B | 7.5 | (6, 8.5) | Reduces \"what if\" regret while managing downside |\n| C | 5.5 | (4.5, 7) | Likely leaves the itch unscratched |\n| D | 7.0 | (5.5, 8.5) | Psychologically hard to be \"half in\" |\n| E | 5.0 | (4, 6.5) | You said you're *passionate*; this likely breeds regret |\n| F | 7.5 | (5, 9) | The \"grown-up\" version of A |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Statistic | Source / Estimate |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Startup failure rate** | ~90% of startups fail; ~75% of VC-backed startups return less than invested capital (Cambridge Associates) |\n| **Solo founder success rate** | Solo founders are ~2x more likely to fail than teams of 2-3 (Startup Genome Project) |\n| **Dev tools TAM concern** | Developer tools companies have historically lower median exits (~$50-100M) vs. enterprise SaaS, though recent exceptions exist (Vercel, HashiCorp, Snyk) |\n| **PM \u2192 Founder transition** | PMs who leave FAANG for startups: ~30% return to big tech within 2 years (LinkedIn workforce data, approximate) |\n| **Age/family factor** | Founders with dependents show *higher* persistence but *lower* risk tolerance, leading to slightly better outcomes conditional on starting (Kauffman Foundation) |\n| **Savings runway** | $200K with a spouse working = ~12-18 months runway in a high-CoL area. Median time to seed funding for a dev tools company: 6-12 months if you have a working prototype and early users |\n| **Google RSU vesting** | Leaving mid-vest cycle at $350K TC likely forfeits $150-300K in unvested equity over the next 2 years |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Binary framing** | \"Should I quit or not?\" ignores 4+ intermediate options that dominate on expected value |\n| **Passion bias / Affect heuristic** | \"I'm passionate about\" \u2192 passion is being used as evidence of viability; these are uncorrelated. Passion predicts persistence, not product-market fit |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | $350K/yr = ~$1K/day. Every day without validated demand is burning $1K in foregone comp. This reframes moonlighting not as \"slow\" but as \"efficient\" |\n| **Survivorship bias** | You're likely anchoring on visible dev-tools success stories (e.g., the founders of Retool, Linear) rather than the thousands of failed dev-tools startups |\n| **Status quo bias (spouse)** | Your household has optimized around dual income + child. Disruption costs are non-linear and often underestimated (stress, relationship strain) |\n| **Sunk cost preview** | Once you quit, commitment escalation makes it hard to stop even when signals are bad |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Expected Value Ranking (weighted composite: 50% Financial, 25% Career Capital, 25% Life Satisfaction)\n\n| Rank | Option | Weighted EV Score |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| **1** | **F. Leave of absence** | Highest \u2014 nearly all upside of A with a reversibility premium |\n| **2** | **B. Moonlight 6-12 months, then decide** | Best risk-adjusted path; validates before you burn |\n| **3** | **D. Recruit co-founder first** | Strong if you can find the right person; solves the solo-founder base rate problem simultaneously |\n| 4 | A. Quit now | Dominated by F and B unless leave of absence is unavailable |\n| 5 | C. Internal transfer | Doesn't address the core desire |\n| 6 | E. Stay + angel | Lowest regret-adjusted satisfaction |\n\n---\n\n### Concrete Recommended Action Plan\n\n> **Phase 1 (Months 1-3): While still at Google**\n> - Talk to 30+ target developer users. Do you have a *problem* or an *idea*? (The #1 reason dev-tools startups fail is building for yourself instead of a market.)\n> - Build an MVP on nights/weekends or recruit a technical co-founder to do so.\n> - Formally explore a leave of absence with your manager/HR.\n>\n> **Phase 2 (Months 3-6): Decision Gate**\n> - **IF** you have \u22655 teams actively using your tool (even free) AND a co-founder committed \u2192 Take the leave of absence (or quit if unavailable). You've now de-risked the biggest variable.\n> - **IF NOT** \u2192 You've saved yourself ~$175K in foregone salary, learned something real, and can iterate or shelve the idea without regret.\n>\n> **Phase 3 (Months 6-18): Full commitment**\n> - Fundraise with traction, not a pitch deck. Dev-tools seed rounds are closing at $3-5M pre on $50K+ ARR or strong open-source adoption signals.\n\n---\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n**Don't quit Monday. Quit *informed*.** The expected value difference between \"quit now with passion\" and \"quit in 4 months with validated demand + a co-founder + a leave of absence as a safety net\" is approximately **$300-500K in risk-adjusted terms** \u2014 and the second path *doesn't reduce your upside*. The only thing it costs is patience, which, if you can't muster for 3-4 months, is itself a signal about founder temperament worth examining.",
