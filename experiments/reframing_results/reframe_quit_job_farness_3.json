Passion \u2260 market demand. Have you validated with 50+ target users? |\n| **Binary Framing** | The question is \"should I quit?\" \u2014 a false binary. Options C, D, E were not considered. This is the single biggest analytical error in the original framing. |\n| **Sunk Cost of Identity** | \"$350K at Google\" is anchoring you. The relevant question is marginal: what does the *next* year look like, not what you're \"giving up\" in total. |\n| **Survivorship Bias** | You likely know successful founder stories. You don't hear about the thousands of dev tools companies that died quietly. |\n| **Optimism Bias** | First-time founders systematically overestimate their probability of success by 2-3x (Cooper, Woo, Dunkelberg 1988 \u2014 still replicated). |\n| **Neglect of Opportunity Cost on Family** | A 2-year-old means this is a *high-burn-rate period* emotionally and financially. The framing underweights spouse's preferences and childcare logistics. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value\u2013Based)\n\n### Composite Expected Value Summary\n\nWeighting KPIs: 40% Financial, 30% Career Capital, 30% Life Satisfaction (normalized)\n\n| Option | Weighted Score | Rank |\n|--------|---------------|------|\n| A: Stay | 6.3 | 4th |\n| B: Quit Full-Time | 5.8 | 5th |\n| C: Moonlight | 5.5 | Last \u2014 dominated |\n| **D: Leave of Absence** | **7.2** | **1st** |\n| E: Co-founder First | 6.5 | 3rd |\n\n### **Primary Recommendation: Option D \u2014 Negotiate a Leave of Absence**\n\n**Rationale:**\n- It captures ~80% of the upside of Option B (full immersion, real signal on PMF) while eliminating the catastrophic downside (burning $200K in savings with a toddler and no fallback).\n- Google offers unpaid personal leave and has a culture of boomerangs. Your manager may resist, but HR policies support it. *Ask before assuming it's impossible.*\n- This turns an irreversible decision into a reversible one \u2014 the single highest-leverage framing shift.\n\n### **If Leave of Absence is unavailable:**\n\n**Go with Option E first, then B conditionally:**\n1. Spend 8 weeks doing rigorous customer discovery *while still employed* (50+ user interviews, a landing page test, a waitlist).\n2. If you get strong signal (>15% conversion on a waitlist, or a LOI from a design partner), *then* quit.\n3. If signal is ambiguous, recruit a technical co-founder willing to go full-time first with your angel investment of $50-100K.\n\n### **Explicitly do NOT do Option B right now.**\n\nThe passion is real but unvalidated. You have a $350K/year safety net that costs you nothing to keep for 60-90 more days while you de-risk. Quitting Monday would be a **$100K+ expected value mistake** driven by affect heuristic and binary framing.\n\n---\n\n*\"The best founders don't take the most risk \u2014 they take risk last, after removing every removable uncertainty.\"*",
