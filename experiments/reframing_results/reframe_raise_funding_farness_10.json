You cannot predict the window. In 2022, fundraising timelines doubled overnight and many 15% MoM growers failed to raise.\n- **Growth rate durability**: Of SaaS companies growing 15% MoM at $500K MRR, roughly **50-60% see growth decelerate** to <10% MoM within 6 months (natural S-curve dynamics, competition, churn accumulation). Your 6-month-from-now self may not have the metrics you're projecting.\n- **Valuation sensitivity to timing**: Waiting 6 months at 15% MoM growth would put you at ~$1.1M MRR. Typical valuation uplift: 50-100% (so $300-400M). But this is the **conditional** estimate\u2014conditional on growth holding AND market staying open. The **unconditional** expected valuation improvement is much lower.\n- **Dilution math reality**: Going from 10% dilution (now) to 7% dilution (later at higher valuation) saves you 3 percentage points. On a $200M company, that's $6M. The **risk** you're taking to save that $6M is existential.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring on valuation** | The question frames this as a valuation optimization problem. It's actually a **survival and optionality** problem. Valuation is a vanity metric until liquidity. |\n| **Overconfidence in growth persistence** | \"We're growing 15% MoM\" implicitly assumes this continues. Base rates say it probably won't at this exact rate. You're planning around the best-case scenario. |\n| **Neglect of macro tail risk** | \"VCs are interested\" describes **today's** market. This is perishable information. The question treats fundraising availability as a constant. It's a variable\u2014and a volatile one. |\n| **Denominator neglect** | Saving 3% dilution feels significant. But 10% of a living company >> 7% of a dead company. The framing ignores the probability-weighted denominator. |\n| **Present bias (inverted)** | Ironically, the instinct to \"wait for a better deal\" is a form of speculative greed dressed as financial discipline. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush\u2014especially when the bush might catch fire. |\n| **Narrative fallacy** | \"Wait until we're bigger for a better valuation\" tells a clean story. Reality is jagged. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### **Raise now. Take the $20M at $200M. This is not close.**\n\n**The expected value calculation:**\n\n$$EV_{\\text{raise now}} = 0.88 \\times \\$120M = \\$105.6M$$\n\n$$EV_{\\text{wait 6 months}} = 0.72 \\times \\$105M = \\$75.6M$$\n\n$$EV_{\\text{wait 12 months}} = 0.45 \\times \\$70M = \\$31.5M$$\n\nEven with generous assumptions about valuation improvement from waiting, **the survival probability discount destroys the valuation upside**.\n\n### Why specifically:\n\n1. **$500K MRR at 15% MoM with VC interest is a strong but not invincible position.** You are at peak narrative. Narratives decay.\n\n2. **12 months of runway is not \"plenty\"\u2014it's a ticking clock.** Best-practice fundraising takes 3-6 months. If you wait 6 months, you'll be raising with 6 months of runway, which is **the danger zone** where VCs smell desperation and terms deteriorate.\n\n3. **The dilution you're \"saving\" is trivially small compared to the risk.** At $200M, $20M is 10% dilution. Even if you waited and raised at $350M, that's ~5.7% dilution. You're risking the company to save **4.3 percentage points of equity**. On a $200M outcome, that's $8.6M. On a $1B outcome, it's $43M\u2014but only if you get there, and cash makes that more likely, not less.\n\n4. **Cash enables the growth that justifies higher future valuations.** With $20M in the bank, you can invest in the sales team, product, and infrastructure that might get you to $2M+ MRR and a $500M+ Series B. Without it, you're running lean and hoping.\n\n5. **Optionality is the real asset.** $20M buys you the right to be aggressive, patient, or opportunistic depending on what the market does. Having options is worth more than optimizing one variable.\n\n### The one exception:\nIf you are **genuinely confident** you can reach profitability within 3-4 months (Option E) without sacrificing growth\u2014meaning your burn is low relative to $500K MRR\u2014then bootstrapping is a defensible contrarian choice. But this is rare at your stage.\n\n> **Bottom line: You are not in the valuation optimization business. You are in the company-building business. Take the money, extend your runway to 3+ years, and go build something worth 10x this valuation. The best time to raise is when you don't have to.**",
