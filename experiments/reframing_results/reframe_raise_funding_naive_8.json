  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: Raise Now, But Strategically\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**Raise now.** But not primarily for the reason you might think, and not without some important nuances.\n\n## The Real Math\n\nLet me lay out what \"waiting\" actually looks like:\n\n**Your current position:**\n- $500K MRR ($6M ARR)\n- 15% MoM growth\n- 12 months runway\n- Potential: $20M at $200M valuation (~33x ARR)\n\n**If you wait 6 months at 15% MoM:**\n- ~$1.15M MRR ($13.8M ARR)\n- Maybe 6 months runway left\n- *Maybe* you raise at $350-400M valuation\n\nThat looks tempting on a spreadsheet. Here's why I'd still raise now:\n\n---\n\n## The Reasons That Actually Matter\n\n**1. You're solving for survival, not dilution optimization.**\n\nThe difference between raising at $200M and $350M is meaningful but not life-changing dilution (~10% vs ~5.7%). The difference between having capital and running out of capital is existential. You are not in the business of optimizing cap tables. You're in the business of winning a market.\n\n**2. 15% MoM is fragile and you know it.**\n\nYou probably won't sustain 15% MoM for 6 more months. Growth almost always has hiccups \u2014 a churned large customer, a delayed product launch, a market shift. If your growth dips to 8% for two months while you have 4 months of runway, your fundraising leverage evaporates *completely.* You go from \"hot deal\" to \"desperate founder\" overnight.\n\n**3. The fundraising environment is not a constant.**\n\nYou're treating VC interest as something you can access anytime. It's not. Markets shift. Partner attention shifts. The competitive landscape shifts. You have interested VCs *right now*. That is a concrete asset with an expiration date.\n\n**4. Capital is a weapon, not just runway.**\n\n$20M doesn't just extend your runway \u2014 it lets you **invest aggressively during a period of proven momentum.** Hire faster, spend on acquisition, build the moat. The opportunity cost of *not* having capital during your highest-growth phase is enormous and invisible.\n\n---\n\n## The Honest Counterarguments I'd Take Seriously\n\n- **If you're already profitable or near-profitable**, the calculus changes. You'd have infinite runway and could wait.\n- **If the $20M comes with bad terms** (heavy liquidation preferences, excessive board control, aggressive anti-dilution), waiting might be worth it.\n- **If you have strong conviction** that a specific milestone (major customer, product launch) in 2-3 months would dramatically change the narrative, a short delay could be strategic.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd Actually Do\n\n1. **Raise now, but run a tight process.** Create competitive dynamics among interested VCs. Don't take the first term sheet.\n2. **Negotiate for what matters** \u2014 minimize liquidation preferences and board control, don't obsess over the last $10M of valuation.\n3. **Raise $15-20M, not more.** Don't over-dilute just because you can. Take enough to get 18-24 months of aggressive runway.\n4. **Set your next milestone clearly.** Use this round to grow into a position where your Series B is at $500M+ on much stronger fundamentals.\n\n---\n\n## The Founder Trap I Want to Name\n\nThe question \"should we wait for a better valuation?\" *feels* like strategic thinking, but it's often **optimizing for ego metrics while gambling with the company's existence.** The best founders I've seen treat fundraising as fuel for execution, not as a scorecard.\n\nYour 15% MoM growth is your strongest negotiating asset. It is also a depreciating one. Use it.\n\n**Raise the round. Go win the market.**",
