Let me walk you through how I'd actually think about it.\n\n---\n\n## First, pressure-test the diagnosis\n\nBefore hiring anyone, make sure you've correctly identified *why* you can't ship fast enough. \"Engineering is the bottleneck\" can mean very different things:\n\n- **People management overhead** is consuming the CTO \u2192 VP Eng probably right\n- **Technical debt / architecture problems** are slowing everyone down \u2192 VP Eng won't fix this\n- **Unclear product requirements** mean engineers build the wrong things \u2192 this is a product/leadership problem\n- **You actually just need 3 more senior engineers** \u2192 a VP managing 15 people may be premature overhead\n- **The CTO is the bottleneck personally** (decision-making, code review, etc.) \u2192 a VP may help, or it may create friction\n\n**Be honest about which of these is actually true.** Talk to your engineers individually, not just your CTO. The CTO's self-diagnosis of \"I'm overwhelmed\" may be accurate, but the *cause* they identify may not be.\n\n---\n\n## If the diagnosis holds, then yes \u2014 but here's what matters\n\n### The case FOR a VP Engineering\n- At 15 engineers post-Series A, you're right at the inflection point where someone needs to own delivery, processes, hiring pipeline, and team health as a *primary job*\n- A good CTO/VP Eng split (architecture + technical vision vs. execution + people) is one of the most powerful leadership structures in startups\n- Your CTO is telling you they need help. Ignoring that risks burning out your most critical person\n\n### The real risks you should worry about\n\n**1. CTO/VP Eng misalignment will destroy your engineering org.**\nThis is the #1 failure mode. If their responsibilities aren't crystal clear, or if the CTO can't actually let go of control, you'll get political confusion that makes shipping *slower*. Your engineers won't know who to listen to.\n\n**2. You might hire the wrong profile.**\nAt 15 people you need a *player-coach* \u2014 someone who can run sprint planning AND jump into a code review. You do NOT need the \"VP Eng from a 500-person org\" who wants to implement SAFe and hire 4 engineering managers. That person will suffocate your team.\n\n**3. This hire takes 3-6 months to find and 3 more months to ramp.**\nIf you need shipping velocity *now*, this doesn't solve your immediate problem. You may need a short-term fix (contract engineers, cutting scope, temporary technical program manager) while you search.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually do, in order\n\n1. **This week:** Have honest 1:1s with 4-5 engineers. Ask *\"what slows you down most?\"* Verify the diagnosis.\n\n2. **If confirmed**, have a direct conversation with your CTO about what they *want* to keep owning vs. give up. Some CTOs say they want a VP Eng but then undermine them because they can't let go. You need to know if your CTO can genuinely share power.\n\n3. **Define the role precisely** before you start recruiting. Write down: who owns hiring decisions, who runs standups, who resolves technical disputes, who owns deadline commitments to the board. If you and the CTO can't agree on these boundaries, you're not ready to hire.\n\n4. **Hire for your stage, not your ambition.** Look for someone who's built and managed a 15\u219240 person eng team, not someone who managed 200. Senior enough to earn respect, humble enough to do hands-on work.\n\n5. **In parallel**, solve the immediate velocity problem separately. Don't load the expectation of \"fix shipping speed in month one\" onto a new VP Eng. That's a setup for failure.\n\n---\n\n## The honest caveat\n\nThere's a scenario where this is the wrong move: **if your CTO is actually underperforming and \"hire a VP Eng\" is a way to avoid that conversation.** I see this pattern a lot. The founding CTO was great at building v1 but can't operate at the next level, and the CEO brings in a VP Eng as a workaround instead of addressing it directly. This always ends badly \u2014 usually with the VP Eng leaving within a year.\n\nIf that's what's happening, that's a different and harder conversation to have.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The instinct is likely right. The execution is what will determine whether this accelerates you or sets you back 6 months. Do the diagnostic work first, get alignment with your CTO on real boundaries, and hire for the stage you're actually at.\n\nWhat does your CTO say when you ask them specifically what they'd *stop doing* if you made this hire?",
