Safe, known. |\n| **B: Wait 6 months** | **110** | 30\u2013200 | *If* growth holds \u2192 2x valuation, ~5% dilution for same $. But wide variance. |\n| **C: Small bridge now** | **115** | 60\u2013190 | 2-3% dilution now, better priced round later, moderate risk |\n| **D: Cut to profitability** | **90** | 40\u2013150 | Zero dilution but may sacrifice growth; market may not reward this |\n| **E: Negotiate current round harder** | **105** | 80\u2013135 | Modest improvement, risk of losing deal momentum |\n\n### KPI 2: P(Survival to Next Milestone)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A: Raise now** | **92%** | 85\u201397% |\n| **B: Wait 6 months** | **65%** | 45\u201380% |\n| **C: Small bridge** | **82%** | 70\u201390% |\n| **D: Profitability** | **70%** | 50\u201385% |\n| **E: Negotiate harder** | **88%** | 78\u201394% |\n\n### KPI 3: Months of Optionality Post-Decision\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A: Raise now** | **24 months** | 18\u201330 |\n| **B: Wait 6 months** | **6 \u2192 then 24** | 4\u20138 \u2192 uncertain |\n| **C: Small bridge** | **18 months** (bridge + eventual raise) | 14\u201324 |\n| **D: Profitability** | **\u221e (if achieved)** | 8\u2013\u221e |\n| **E: Negotiate** | **22 months** | 16\u201328 |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Data Point | Source/Logic |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **Startups sustaining 15% MoM for 6+ consecutive months** | ~20-30% of those currently at that rate. Growth almost always decelerates. Y Combinator data shows median growth decay of 2-4 points per quarter. |\n| **VC funding environment reversals** | In 2022, available VC funding dropped ~35% in a single quarter. Windows close fast. |\n| **Startups that die with \"we could have raised\"** | ~60% of startup deaths cite running out of cash; a significant subset had term sheets they didn't take. |\n| **Valuation premium from waiting 6 months (at 15% MoM)** | Theoretical: $500K \u2192 $1.1M MRR at same 33x multiple = $370M. But multiple compression is common as you scale\u2014realized premium is often 1.3-1.7x, not 2x. |\n| **Bridge rounds converting to strong priced rounds** | ~65-75% when company is performing; bridges from existing investors convert at higher rates. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Anchoring on valuation** | The question is framed as \"$200M vs. bigger later\" \u2014 but valuation is a vanity metric. **Dilution-adjusted expected value is what matters.** Getting 5% less dilution is worthless if it costs you a 35% chance of dying. |\n| **Overconfidence in growth persistence** | \"We're growing 15% MoM\" implicitly assumes this continues. The base rate says it probably won't. You are likely at or near a local maximum of your growth rate. |\n| **Neglect of optionality value** | Cash in hand has *enormous* option value that doesn't show up in a simple dilution calculation. The ability to survive a recession, outlast a competitor, or make an acquisition is worth real money. |\n| **Survivorship bias from VC narratives** | You hear about companies that waited and got 10x valuations. You don't hear about the ones that waited and died. This is *massive* selection bias. |\n| **False binary framing** | The question presents exactly two options. There are at least five. The bridge option is conspicuously absent. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Expected Value Summary (Survival-Weighted)\n\n| Option | E[Value] \u00d7 P(Survival) | Risk Profile |\n|--------|----------------------|--------------|\n| A: Raise now | 100 \u00d7 0.92 = **92.0** | Low risk, solid floor |\n| B: Wait 6 months | 110 \u00d7 0.65 = **71.5** | High risk, high variance |\n| C: Small bridge | 115 \u00d7 0.82 = **94.3** | Moderate risk, best EV |\n| D: Profitability | 90 \u00d7 0.70 = **63.0** | High risk, contrarian |\n| E: Negotiate harder | 105 \u00d7 0.88 = **92.4** | Low-moderate risk |\n\n---\n\n### Primary Recommendation: **Option C (Small Bridge) or Option A (Raise Now)**\n\n**If you have an existing investor or warm lead willing to do a $3-5M bridge on a SAFE at $200M+ cap:**\n\u2192 Take the bridge. You extend runway to ~18 months, take minimal dilution (2-3%), and give yourself a shot at a significantly better priced round when you're at $1M+ MRR. This is the highest expected value path.\n\n**If a clean bridge isn't available within 3-4 weeks:**\n\u2192 **Raise the $20M now.** Do not wait.\n\n### The core logic:\n\n> **A 10% dilution difference is worth approximately nothing compared to a 27-percentage-point increase in survival probability.** The framing of this decision as \"valuation optimization\" is itself the error. This is a *survival* decision masquerading as a *valuation* decision.\n\n### What \"Wait 6 Months\" Would Need to Be Correct\nFor Option B to be rational, you would need to believe:\n- P(growth sustains at 12%+ MoM for 6 months) > 75%\n- P(VC market stays equally receptive) > 85%\n- P(no competitive/macro shocks) > 90%\n\nThe joint probability of all three is roughly **50-55%** at best. That's a coin flip with your company's life.\n\n### **Take the money. The best time to raise is when you can.**",
