  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: Raise Now, But Thoughtfully\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**Raise now.** But not for the reason most founders think, and with some important caveats.\n\n## The Core Reasoning\n\n**Let me work through the math first:**\n\n- $500K MRR = $6M ARR\n- At 15% MoM growth, in 6 months you'd be at ~$1.15M MRR (~$14M ARR)\n- That *could* command a higher valuation, maybe $400M+\n- But you'd have only 6 months of runway left, which is a **terrible negotiating position**\n\n**This is the fundamental tension:** Waiting improves your metrics but destroys your leverage.\n\n## Why Raise Now \u2014 The Real Reasons\n\n**1. Runway leverage is everything**\nWith 12 months left, you can walk away from a bad deal. With 6 months, VCs know you can't. The \"better valuation\" you'd theoretically earn gets eaten by desperation discount.\n\n**2. The market isn't guaranteed**\nVC sentiment shifts fast. Interest rates, a market correction, a sector rotation \u2014 the $20M that's available today may not be there in 6 months. You've seen what happened in 2022.\n\n**3. 15% MoM compounds both ways**\nIf growth dips to even 10% for a couple months (a bad churn cohort, a sales hire that doesn't work out), your story weakens *and* your runway shrinks simultaneously.\n\n**4. $20M at $200M is not a bad deal**\nThat's ~33x ARR multiple with 10% dilution. That's strong. Optimizing for an extra 2-3% less dilution is not worth the existential risk.\n\n## The Honest Counterargument\n\nThere *is* a case for waiting:\n- If you're approaching profitability and could extend runway to 18+ months independently\n- If the $20M comes with terms you genuinely dislike (aggressive liquidation preferences, board control)\n- If you have strong conviction that a specific near-term milestone (major enterprise contract, regulatory approval) would be a step-change in valuation\n\n**But \"the number might be bigger later\" is not a sufficient reason.** That's optimizing for ego, not for the company.\n\n## What I'd Actually Do\n\n1. **Raise now, but run a disciplined process.** Talk to multiple firms. Create competitive tension. 2-3 weeks, not 2-3 months.\n2. **Don't take the first term sheet.** Interested VCs at $200M suggests you might get $220-240M with competition.\n3. **Raise slightly more than you think you need** \u2014 if you can get $25M at similar dilution, take it. Buffer matters.\n4. **Negotiate on terms, not just valuation.** Pro-rata rights, board seats, and protective provisions matter more than a $20M valuation difference.\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nThe graveyard of startups is full of companies that were \"waiting for a better valuation.\" It is almost never full of companies that raised too early at a fair price.\n\nYou have a great business growing fast with interested investors. **Take the money, get back to building, and make the valuation look like a steal in retrospect.**\n\nThat's how the best outcomes actually happen.",
