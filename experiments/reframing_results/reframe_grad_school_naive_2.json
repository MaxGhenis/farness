  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis\n\nThis is a major decision, so let me walk through it honestly rather than just cheerleading.\n\n## The Real Cost\n\nLet's be blunt about the total price tag:\n\n- **Tuition:** ~$160K\n- **Lost wages (2 years):** ~$260K+\n- **Total cost:** ~$420K+\n\nThat's the number you need to justify.\n\n## The Key Question: *Why* do you want the MBA?\n\nThis matters enormously, and you didn't mention it, which slightly concerns me.\n\n### Scenarios where it's likely **worth it:**\n- You want to transition into **management consulting, investment banking, or PE** (MBA is essentially required)\n- You want to move into **product management or business leadership** at a senior level\n- You have a specific industry/role shift that requires the credential and network\n- The program is **top ~15** (the network premium drops off sharply after that)\n\n### Scenarios where it's likely **NOT worth it:**\n- You want to keep being an engineer (an MBA won't help much and may hurt momentum)\n- You're going because you're \"bored\" or it feels like a default prestige move\n- The program is outside the top ~20-25\n- You're mainly hoping for a salary bump (senior/staff engineers often out-earn MBAs)\n\n## Things people underestimate\n\n- **Software engineering compensation curves are exceptional.** At 3 years in, you're early. Senior engineers at strong companies make $200-400K+. You may be leaving right before the steep part of your curve.\n- **MBA ROI is bimodal.** The average salary stats are inflated by finance/consulting pipelines. If you don't go into those tracks, the median outcome is less impressive.\n- **The network is real but not magic.** It helps most in traditional industries. Tech already has strong hiring networks.\n- **2 years away from engineering means skill atrophy** in a fast-moving field.\n\n## What I'd actually recommend\n\n**Before deciding, answer these honestly:**\n\n1. Which specific program? (Rank matters a lot)\n2. What job do you want 5 years after graduating?\n3. Can you get that job *without* the MBA?\n4. Have you talked to MBA grads doing what you want to do?\n\n**My honest lean:** Unless this is a top-10 program AND you have a clear goal that requires it, the math is hard to justify for a software engineer. Your current trajectory likely gets you to $200K+ within 2-3 years without spending $420K.\n\nBut if you want to leave engineering entirely for finance, consulting, or a C-suite business track \u2014 that changes the calculus significantly.\n\nWhat's the actual program, and what's pulling you toward it?",
