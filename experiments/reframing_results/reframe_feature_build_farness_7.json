Have you surveyed the silent 170+ customers? |\n| **\ud83d\udd28 Anchoring on the stated option** | The question frames this as binary (build native or don't), suppressing intermediate options (PWA, responsive, hybrid) that may dominate |\n| **\ud83d\udc8e IKEA Effect / Sunk Cost Preview** | $200K and 4 months feels concrete and plannable, making it psychologically \"real\" versus vaguer alternatives \u2014 this makes people underweight opportunity cost |\n| **\ud83d\udcf1 Shiny Object Bias** | \"Mobile app\" carries prestige. Teams often conflate \"having an app\" with \"solving mobile usability.\" The actual job-to-be-done may be simpler |\n| **\u26a1 Neglect of Opportunity Cost** | 4 engineering-months and $200K could ship 3\u20135 high-impact web features. What's the next-best use of that budget? |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### **Recommended: Option B \u2014 Progressive Web App (PWA)**\n\n**Rationale by expected value:**\n\n```\nExpected Net Revenue (12mo):\n  Native App:   E[V] = +$80K,  but high variance, 4x the cost\n  PWA:          E[V] = +$100K, tighter CI, ~25% of cost\n  \nRisk-adjusted ROI:\n  Native:  $80K / $200K  = 0.40x\n  PWA:     $100K / $50K  = 2.00x  \u2190 5x better capital efficiency\n```\n\n**Specific action plan:**\n\n1. **Immediately (Week 1):** Survey all 200 customers on mobile use cases. Quantify actual demand vs. vocal minority. Identify the top 3 jobs-to-be-done on mobile.\n\n2. **Phase 1 (Weeks 2\u20138, ~$50K):** Build a PWA targeting those top 3 use cases \u2014 push notifications, offline access, home-screen install. This captures ~80% of native value at ~25% of cost.\n\n3. **Measure (Months 3\u20136):** Track KPI 2 (mobile engagement). If weekly mobile engagement exceeds 25% of active users, **then** revisit native.\n\n4. **Phase 2 (Conditional):** Only build native if PWA engagement proves the market AND you identify native-only capabilities (camera, GPS, biometrics) that are core to the workflow.\n\n### Why NOT native now?\n- At 200 customers, you are almost certainly **pre-product-market-fit for mobile** \u2014 you don't yet know which mobile experiences matter\n- $200K is likely 5\u201315% of your annual engineering budget; the opportunity cost is severe\n- The base rate says most B2B companies at your scale regret building native early\n- A PWA is a reversible, information-generating decision; a native app is a **maintenance commitment forever**\n\n> **Bottom line:** Don't build the $200K answer to a question you haven't fully validated. Build the $50K experiment that tells you whether the $200K is warranted.",
