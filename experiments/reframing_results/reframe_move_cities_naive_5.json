  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your SF Offer\n\nThis is a significant decision, so let me help you break it down honestly rather than just give you a snap answer.\n\n## The Money (It's More Nuanced Than It Looks)\n\nThe $70K raise sounds great, but let's be real about SF costs:\n\n- **Housing** is the big one. A comparable place in SF might cost $1,500-2,500+/more per month than Austin. That's $18-30K/year after tax, maybe $25-40K pre-tax.\n- **State income tax**: Texas has none. California will take roughly ~9-10% on your marginal income. That's meaningful - potentially $15-20K+.\n- **Food, transit, general expenses**: Moderately higher.\n\n**Rough math**: Your $70K raise could shrink to something like **$10-25K in real purchasing power gain**, depending on your lifestyle. It's likely still a net positive, but it's not life-changing money.\n\n## The Things That Might Matter More Than the Math\n\n**Reasons this could still be worth it:**\n- Career trajectory. SF network and resume signal can compound over years.\n- What's the equity/total comp picture? $250K base in SF often comes with significant equity.\n- Do you *want* to live in SF? City energy, culture, proximity to the industry.\n- Future offers get anchored to your current comp. $250K base resets your ceiling.\n\n**Reasons to be cautious:**\n- Austin's tech scene is strong and growing. You're not stuck in a backwater.\n- You already own a home? Austin equity vs. SF renting is a big lifestyle difference.\n- Quality of life factors: space, commute, cost stress.\n- Is your current role actually limiting you, or are you just attracted to the number?\n\n## The Questions I'd Push You to Answer Honestly\n\n1. **Why are you considering leaving?** If you're happy in Austin and this is purely about money, the math probably doesn't justify the disruption.\n2. **What's the total comp, not just base?** RSUs/equity could change everything.\n3. **Could you counter your current employer?** A raise to $210-220K in Austin might beat $250K in SF on real purchasing power.\n4. **What does your partner actually prefer?** \"Flexible\" doesn't mean indifferent. This affects them too.\n5. **Is this role genuinely better for your career**, or is it a lateral move with a bigger number?\n\n## My Honest Take\n\n**Don't take it for the money alone** - the real gain is modest after cost adjustment. **Do take it if** the role is meaningfully better for your career growth, you're excited about SF, and your partner is genuinely on board.\n\nThe strongest move might actually be to **use the offer as leverage** for a significant raise in Austin, where your dollars go further. But that only works if you'd genuinely accept the SF role as a fallback.\n\nWhat's driving the pull for you - is it the money, the role, or something else?",
