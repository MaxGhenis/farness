Your $180K Austin may already be *financially superior*.\n- **Remote negotiation success rate:** ~40-50% of offers can be negotiated for remote/hybrid post-COVID, especially at senior level (Blind surveys 2023-24).\n- **Regret rates on relocation:** Highest when driven primarily by compensation rather than role/mission fit.\n- **Dual-income impact:** Your partner works remotely \u2014 no second income disruption, which removes one of the biggest relocation risks.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Anchoring on nominal salary** | \"$250K vs. $180K\" *feels* like a 39% raise. After taxes and COL, it's roughly **0% to -10%** in Year 1 purchasing power. The $70K gap is an illusion. |\n| **Neglect of hidden option** | The framing is binary (\"should I take it?\") when the highest-EV options (negotiate remote, leverage for raise) aren't even on the table. |\n| **Status/prestige bias** | \"$250K in SF\" carries social signal value that may be unconsciously inflating its attractiveness. |\n| **Present bias** | The offer feels urgent. But you now have *information* ($250K market rate) that has value regardless of whether you accept. |\n| **Omission of transition costs** | Moving costs, deposit losses, 2-3 months of reduced productivity, social network rebuild \u2014 easily $15-30K in direct + indirect costs. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value)\n\n### Optimal strategy, in priority order:\n\n**\u2192 FIRST: Negotiate the SF offer for remote/hybrid from Austin.**\n\nThis is the highest expected value play across all three KPIs. You get SF-tier compensation (even at a 10-15% remote discount, ~$215-225K in Austin demolishes all alternatives on discretionary income), maintain quality of life, and access the career network benefits partially.\n\n**Probability of success: ~35-45%.** Worth attempting first because the downside is zero.\n\n**\u2192 IF THAT FAILS: Use the offer to negotiate in Austin.**\n\nGo to your current employer with a competing offer. A bump to $200-210K in Austin gives you the best risk-adjusted financial outcome and highest quality of life. Even $195K in Austin likely beats $250K in SF on net discretionary income.\n\n**\u2192 IF BOTH FAIL: The SF move is a *career investment*, not a financial win.**\n\nTake it **only if** you believe the 5-year career trajectory matters more than near-term finances, AND you're genuinely excited about the role/company, not just the number. The expected financial value is roughly neutral in years 1-2 and positive only in years 3-5 through compounding career effects.\n\n### Bottom line\n\n> **The $250K number is doing psychological work that the actual economics don't support.** Your strongest move is to convert this offer into leverage \u2014 either for remote work or an Austin raise. Moving to SF for the money alone is approximately break-even. Move only if the *role itself* is a clear career accelerant.",
