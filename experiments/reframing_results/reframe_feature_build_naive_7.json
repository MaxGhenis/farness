  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: **Not yet \u2014 but don't ignore the signal.**\n\nHere's my reasoning, broken down into the questions I think actually matter:\n\n---\n\n## First, clarify what you don't know yet\n\nBefore spending $200K, I'd want answers to these questions:\n\n- **How many of the 200 customers are asking?** If it's 8 vocal ones, that's very different from 80. A small minority can feel like \"everyone.\"\n- **What specifically are they trying to do on mobile?** Check dashboards? Approve workflows? Get notifications? The use case matters enormously.\n- **Are you losing deals because of this?** If prospects are choosing competitors with native apps, that changes the calculus. If it's a nice-to-have from existing customers, it's lower priority.\n- **What would they do if your mobile web experience was just... good?** This is the critical question most teams skip.\n\n---\n\n## The case against building it now\n\n- **$200K + 4 months is the optimistic estimate.** Real cost includes ongoing maintenance, two platforms to support, app store review cycles, and feature parity pressure. Year-one true cost is probably $300-400K+.\n- **At 200 customers, that's $1,000-2,000 per customer** in investment \u2014 hard to justify unless it directly drives expansion revenue or retention.\n- **You'll split your engineering focus.** Every feature now ships twice, gets tested twice, gets bugs twice.\n\n## The case for building it\n\n- It becomes a real competitive differentiator\n- Mobile-specific features (push notifications, offline access, camera) unlock new use cases\n- It signals product maturity to enterprise buyers\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually do instead (a phased approach)\n\n### Phase 1: Spend $20-40K and 3-4 weeks making your mobile web experience genuinely good.\nResponsive design, touch-friendly UI, fast load times. A good PWA (Progressive Web App) can even add push notifications and home-screen install. **This solves 70-80% of what users are probably actually asking for.**\n\n### Phase 2: Instrument and learn.\nTrack mobile usage patterns closely. Now you'll have real data on what people actually do on mobile, not what they say they'd do.\n\n### Phase 3: Make the native app decision with evidence.\nIf mobile usage is high and you can identify use cases that genuinely require native capabilities, build it \u2014 but you'll build the *right* app because you learned from Phase 1-2.\n\n---\n\n## The bottom line\n\n**\"Our users are asking for a mobile app\"** often really means **\"our mobile experience is frustrating.\"** Solve the frustration first. It's faster, cheaper, and reversible. A native app is a major ongoing commitment \u2014 you want to be *pulled* into it by clear evidence, not *pushed* into it by a few loud requests.\n\nIf after Phase 1-2 the data says build it \u2014 build it with confidence.\n\n---\n\n*One caveat: If you're hearing this in **sales** calls and it's costing you deals against specific competitors, move faster. Lost revenue changes the math quickly. But even then, I'd want to validate that with your sales team rigorously \u2014 \"we lost because no mobile app\" is sometimes a convenient explanation for other issues.*",
