  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis\n\nThis is a significant decision, so let me walk through it honestly rather than just cheerleading.\n\n## The Real Cost\n\nLet's be blunt about the total price tag:\n\n- **Tuition:** $160K\n- **Lost income (2 years):** ~$260K+\n- **Total opportunity cost:** ~$420K+\n\nThat's the hole you're climbing out of.\n\n## The Key Question You Need to Answer\n\n**What do you want the MBA to *do* for you?**\n\nThis is where most people's thinking is too vague. The MBA ROI varies dramatically:\n\n### It likely makes sense if:\n- You want to **switch into** management consulting, investment banking, product management at top firms, or corporate strategy\n- You want to break into industries where an MBA is essentially a **gatekeeper credential**\n- The program has strong recruiting pipelines to your target companies\n- You've hit a ceiling that's specifically credential-related, not skill-related\n- You value the network and are the type to actively leverage it\n\n### It likely does NOT make sense if:\n- You want to keep being a software engineer (even as a senior/staff engineer)\n- Your main goal is just \"earning more\" \u2014 senior SWEs at strong companies clear $200-400K+ without an MBA\n- You're going because you're restless or uncertain and it \"feels like progress\"\n- You haven't researched specific post-MBA outcomes at this program\n\n## Some Honest Realities\n\n**In favor:**\n- Good MBA programs genuinely open doors to careers that are otherwise very hard to access\n- The network compounds over a lifetime\n- Age/timing-wise, 3 years of experience is a reasonable point to go\n- Career optionality has real value\n\n**Against:**\n- Software engineering is one of the *few* fields where MBA ROI is weakest, because your earning trajectory is already strong\n- Many engineers report the MBA didn't teach them things they couldn't learn on the job\n- You're young enough that 2 years of compounding experience, promotions, and equity could be very valuable\n- Student debt constrains future risk-taking (starting a company, joining a startup, etc.)\n\n## My Honest Recommendation\n\n**Don't go *unless* you have a clear career direction that specifically requires it.**\n\nIf your answer is \"I want to move into [specific role/industry] and this program places well into that\" \u2014 go. It'll pay off.\n\nIf your answer is \"it's a good program and it'll probably help somehow\" \u2014 that's a $420K bet on vagueness. I'd push back hard on that.\n\n## What I'd Do Before Deciding\n\n1. **Talk to 5-10 alumni** from this specific program who had your background. Where are they now? Was it worth it?\n2. **Look at the employment report** \u2014 median post-MBA comp, and specifically for career switchers from tech\n3. **Honestly ask:** Could you reach your goal without the MBA in 2-3 more years of focused career moves?\n\nWhat's the career outcome you're actually hoping for? I can give you much sharper advice with that context.",
