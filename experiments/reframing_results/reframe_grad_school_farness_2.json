  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis: Farness Framework\n\n## 1. Defining Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **NPV of Lifetime Earnings** | Present value of all future earnings (discount rate 5%) over 20-year horizon | 20 years |\n| **Career Optionality Score** | Number of distinct career paths accessible (roles \u00d7 industries) | 5 years post-decision |\n| **Risk-Adjusted Satisfaction** | Probability of being in a role you'd rate \u22658/10 | 5 years post-decision |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Options (Including Unmentioned)\n\n- **A.** Enroll full-time in MBA (as proposed)\n- **B.** Stay in current SWE role, aggressively pursue promotions/job-hops\n- **C.** Part-time / Executive MBA while working\n- **D.** Skip MBA; invest $160K+ in a startup or angel portfolio\n- **E.** Targeted skill pivot (e.g., 3-6 month intensive in ML/AI, product management bootcamp) + job hop\n\n---\n\n## 3. Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: NPV of Incremental Earnings Over 20 Years (vs. staying at current trajectory baseline of ~$0)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A. Full-time MBA** | +$180K | (\u2212$200K to +$600K) |\n| **B. Stay & promote (SWE)** | +$350K | (+$100K to +$800K) |\n| **C. Part-time MBA** | +$220K | (+$50K to +$450K) |\n| **D. Startup/invest** | +$50K | (\u2212$300K to +$2M) |\n| **E. Skill pivot + hop** | +$300K | (+$80K to +$700K) |\n\n**Key assumptions for Option A:**\n- Total cost: ~$360K (tuition $160K + foregone salary ~$200K after tax adjustments)\n- Post-MBA median salary: ~$155K (GMAC 2023 data for tech-background MBAs)\n- Upside comes from pivoting into PM, consulting, or finance at $170K-$220K+\n- SWE without MBA can reach $200-350K at senior/staff levels within the same 2-year window via promotion or FAANG hop\n\n### KPI 2: Career Optionality (Accessible Paths, scale 1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A. Full-time MBA** | 9 | (7 to 10) |\n| **B. Stay & promote** | 5 | (4 to 7) |\n| **C. Part-time MBA** | 7 | (5 to 8) |\n| **D. Startup** | 6 | (3 to 8) |\n| **E. Skill pivot** | 6 | (5 to 8) |\n\n### KPI 3: P(Role Satisfaction \u2265 8/10) at Year 5\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A. Full-time MBA** | 55% | (35% to 70%) |\n| **B. Stay & promote** | 40% | (25% to 60%) |\n| **C. Part-time MBA** | 50% | (30% to 65%) |\n| **D. Startup** | 35% | (15% to 60%) |\n| **E. Skill pivot** | 50% | (30% to 65%) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **Post-MBA salary premium for engineers:** GMAC 2023 reports median pre-to-post MBA salary increase of ~$30-50K. But SWE is *already a high-paying field* \u2014 the premium is smaller than for career-changers from low-paying industries.\n- **SWE salary growth without MBA:** Engineers who job-hop every 2-3 years see 15-25% increases per hop (Levels.fyi data). A 3-YOE engineer can reach $200K+ within 1-2 years at a top-tier company *without* an MBA.\n- **MBA ROI by pre-MBA salary:** Research (Poets & Quants, Financial Times) shows ROI *decreases* as pre-MBA salary increases. The breakeven for someone at $130K is typically 7-12 years. For someone at $60K it's 3-5 years.\n- **MBA dropout from tech who return to tech:** ~40% of tech-background MBA students return to tech roles (often PM, not SWE) \u2014 meaning the degree didn't unlock a fundamentally different industry.\n- **\"Good\" program specificity matters enormously:** M7 (HBS, Wharton, Stanford GSB, etc.) vs. T15 vs. T25 have vastly different outcomes. The analysis above assumes T15.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Sunk cost / Commitment bias** | \"I got in\" creates pressure to attend \u2014 admission feels like an asset you'll lose |\n| **Prestige bias** | MBA carries social/identity signaling value that inflates perceived career value |\n| **Anchoring on tuition only** | The question frames cost as $160K, but the true cost is **~$360K** including opportunity cost |\n| **Narrow framing** | Presented as binary (go vs. don't), ignoring Options C, D, E |\n| **Neglect of base rate for SWE trajectory** | Engineers systematically underestimate how high their earnings can go *without* credentials \u2014 staff/principal engineers at FAANG earn $400-700K |\n| **Narrative bias** | MBA \"transformation stories\" are memorable and over-indexed vs. the median quiet outcome |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendation\n\n### Expected Value Summary (weighted composite)\n\n| Option | Financial EV | Optionality | Satisfaction | **Composite Rank** |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **B. Stay & promote** | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605 | **Strong default** |\n| **E. Skill pivot + hop** | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 | **Best risk-adjusted** |\n| **C. Part-time MBA** | \u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605 | **Best compromise** |\n| **A. Full-time MBA** | \u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 | **Conditional** |\n| **D. Startup** | \u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605\u2605 | \u2605\u2605 | **High variance** |\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n> **Do NOT default to \"yes\" based on admission alone.**\n\nThe MBA is the **right choice ONLY IF:**\n1. You are **actively unhappy in SWE** and want to exit engineering entirely (into consulting, finance, general management, or entrepreneurship), AND\n2. The program is **M7/T10** (otherwise the network premium doesn't justify the cost), AND\n3. You've confirmed the specific post-MBA role you're targeting pays enough to break even within ~7 years.\n\n**If you still enjoy engineering or would consider PM/technical leadership**, Option E (targeted upskilling + strategic job hop to FAANG/unicorn) or Option C (part-time MBA) dominate on expected value. You keep compounding your salary, avoid $360K in total costs, and can still pivot.\n\n### The uncomfortable question to answer honestly:\n*\"Am I pursuing this MBA for career ROI, or for identity/prestige/a reset button?\"* Both are valid \u2014 but only one survives an NPV calculation.",
