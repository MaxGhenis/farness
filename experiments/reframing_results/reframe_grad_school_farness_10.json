  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis: Farness Framework\n\n## 1. Define Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **NPV of Lifetime Earnings** | Present value of all future earnings minus costs, discounted at 5% | 20 years post-decision |\n| **Career Optionality Score** | Number of distinct career paths accessible (measurable proxy: breadth of roles you'd be a competitive candidate for) | 5 years post-decision |\n| **Satisfaction-Adjusted Risk** | Probability of being in a role you'd rate \u22658/10 satisfaction | 5 years post-decision |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Options Identified\n\n| # | Option | Notes |\n|---|--------|-------|\n| A | **Enroll in MBA full-time now** | As described |\n| B | **Stay in current SWE role, pursue promotions** | Status quo |\n| C | **Defer MBA 2-3 years** | More experience, higher pre-MBA salary, potentially stronger recruiting |\n| D | **Part-time / executive MBA** | Keep earning while studying |\n| E | **Pivot without MBA** (bootcamp, self-study, internal transfer) | Move into PM, management, or startup without degree |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: 20-Year NPV of Incremental Earnings (vs. staying in SWE)\n\n*All figures in present-value dollars, discounted at 5%. Costs include tuition + foregone salary.*\n\n| Option | Total Cost | Point Estimate NPV Gain | 80% CI |\n|--------|-----------|------------------------|--------|\n| **A: MBA now** | ~$420K (tuition $160K + $260K foregone earnings) | **+$250K** | (-$100K to +$800K) |\n| **B: Stay SWE** | $0 | **$0** (baseline) | (-$200K to +$400K) |\n| **C: Defer 2-3 yrs** | ~$450K (higher foregone salary) | **+$350K** | (-$50K to +$900K) |\n| **D: Part-time MBA** | ~$180K (tuition, no foregone salary) | **+$200K** | (+$0 to +$500K) |\n| **E: Pivot without MBA** | ~$10K | **+$100K** | (-$150K to +$400K) |\n\n### KPI 2: Career Optionality (distinct accessible career paths, out of ~10 archetypes)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A: MBA now | **8** | (6 to 10) |\n| B: Stay SWE | **4** | (3 to 6) |\n| C: Defer MBA | **8** | (7 to 10) |\n| D: Part-time MBA | **6** | (5 to 8) |\n| E: Pivot no MBA | **5** | (3 to 7) |\n\n### KPI 3: P(role satisfaction \u2265 8/10) at year 5\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A: MBA now | **55%** | (35% to 70%) |\n| B: Stay SWE | **40%** | (25% to 60%) |\n| C: Defer MBA | **60%** | (40% to 75%) |\n| D: Part-time MBA | **45%** | (30% to 60%) |\n| E: Pivot no MBA | **40%** | (20% to 60%) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **Median post-MBA salary at top-15 programs:** ~$175K (GMAC 2023), with SWE backgrounds often landing $190-220K+ in tech PM, strategy, or consulting roles\n- **SWE salary trajectory without MBA (3 YoE \u2192 10 YoE):** Median ~$130K \u2192 $190-250K at senior/staff levels (Levels.fyi data), but **top-quartile SWEs at FAANG reach $350-500K+ TC without any MBA**\n- **MBA ROI studies (Poets & Quants, Financial Times):** Median time to recoup investment is **~4 years** for top-20 programs, but **variance is enormous** \u2014 bottom-quartile graduates take 10+ years or never recoup\n- **Career switchers vs. accelerators:** ~60-70% of MBA students switch industries; those who return to tech often report **lower ROI** than those switching from lower-paying fields\n- **The \"SWE exception\":** Software engineers already earn in the top ~10% of pre-MBA salaries. Studies show **MBA ROI is inversely correlated with pre-MBA salary** \u2014 the higher your starting point, the harder to justify the gap\n- **Dropout/regret rates:** ~10-15% of MBA grads report the degree \"wasn't worth it\" (GMAC alumni surveys); this rises for those who had high-paying pre-MBA careers\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Sunk cost of admission** | You worked hard to get in. The acceptance letter feels like it *must* be used. But acceptance is not an argument for attendance. |\n| **Prestige bias / social proof** | \"Good MBA program\" triggers status heuristics. The question is whether *you* capture the premium, not whether the brand is impressive. |\n| **Grass-is-greener / status quo aversion** | 3 years at one job can feel stale. The MBA may feel like \"escape\" rather than a calculated investment. Ask: *Am I running toward something or away from something?* |\n| **Anchoring on salary jumps** | You may anchor on $175K+ median post-MBA salary, but your *counterfactual* isn't $130K \u2014 it's what you'd earn in 2 years without the MBA (~$155-170K+). The real delta is smaller than it looks. |\n| **Neglect of variance** | People focus on median outcomes. The 80% CIs above are wide. The MBA is a **high-variance bet**, not a guaranteed payoff. |\n| **Omission of non-obvious options** | The framing is binary (go/don't go). Options C, D, and E are systematically under-considered. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendation\n\n### Bottom line: **Don't go now. Strongly consider Option C (defer 2-3 years) or Option D (part-time).**\n\n**The reasoning:**\n\n**1. The NPV case for an MBA *right now* is marginal for a software engineer.**\nYour opportunity cost is among the highest of any MBA applicant pool. At $130K and rising, you're forfeiting ~$260K+ in earnings plus $160K tuition = **~$420K total cost**. The median MBA salary bump for someone *already in tech* is not large enough to confidently clear this hurdle. Expected NPV is positive but the confidence interval includes significant negative outcomes.\n\n**2. Deferring dominates on almost every KPI.**\nWith 5-6 YoE, you'd enter with: a higher pre-MBA salary (better anchoring for post-MBA negotiation), more managerial experience (stronger recruiting profile), greater clarity on *why* you want the MBA (reducing the variance in satisfaction outcomes), and many programs allow 2-3 year deferrals.\n\n**3. The question you need to answer first:**\n*What do I want to do that I provably cannot do without an MBA?*\n\n- If the answer is **management consulting, investment banking, or general management at a Fortune 500** \u2192 the MBA is the credentialing ticket, and it makes sense. Go.\n- If the answer is **PM, engineering management, or startup leadership in tech** \u2192 the MBA is nice-to-have but not necessary, and the ROI is likely negative vs. just pursuing those paths directly.\n- If the answer is **\"I'm not sure, I just want more options\"** \u2192 that's a $420K exploration exercise. Defer until you have a clearer thesis.\n\n### Decision rule:\n> **Go NOW only if** you have a specific post-MBA career target that (a) requires the credential and (b) has expected compensation that clears the $420K hurdle by a comfortable margin. Otherwise, defer or pursue part-time.",
