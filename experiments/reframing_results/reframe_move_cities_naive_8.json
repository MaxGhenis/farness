  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your SF Offer\n\nThis is a significant decision, and I want to be genuinely helpful rather than just give you a simple answer. Let me walk through what I think matters.\n\n## The Financial Reality\n\nThe $70K raise sounds great, but let's be honest about what SF costs:\n\n- **Housing** is the big one. A comparable place in SF might cost $1,500-$3,000+/month more than Austin. That's $18K-$36K/year just in rent/mortgage difference.\n- **State income tax**: Texas has none. California will take roughly 9-10% on your income, so ~$20-25K more in state taxes.\n- **Everything else** (food, insurance, general cost of living) adds up too.\n\n**Rough math**: After adjusting for taxes and housing alone, you could be roughly **break-even or even slightly behind** in real purchasing power. The $70K raise might effectively be a $0-15K raise, or possibly a pay cut depending on your lifestyle.\n\n## What I'd Actually Push You To Think About\n\nThe financial comparison is the easy part. The harder questions:\n\n- **Why do you want to leave your current role?** If you're happy in Austin, a lateral-in-real-terms move to a more expensive city is hard to justify on money alone.\n- **What does the SF role offer for your career trajectory?** If it's a stronger company, better title path, more interesting problems, or access to a network you can't get in Austin - that has real long-term value that dwarfs the salary math.\n- **How does your partner actually feel?** \"Flexible\" and \"enthusiastic\" are different things. Moving away from their community for a financially neutral move can create resentment.\n- **Do you want to live in SF?** This sounds obvious but people under-weight it. The lifestyle is genuinely different.\n\n## What I'd Push Back On\n\nIf the main draw is the number on the offer letter, **I'd lean toward not taking it** - or negotiating harder. You could:\n\n- Counter at $280-300K, which would make it a real raise after cost adjustment\n- Ask for remote/hybrid flexibility (even a few months/year in Austin changes the math)\n- Use the offer to negotiate a raise in Austin\n\n## My Honest Take\n\n**Don't take it purely for the money - it's probably not actually more money.** Take it if the role, company, or career opportunity is meaningfully better, and you and your partner are genuinely excited about SF. If it's just a bigger number, you likely have a better quality of life staying in Austin.\n\nWhat's actually pulling you toward this offer? That would help me give you sharper advice.",
