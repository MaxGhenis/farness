  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis: Farness Framework\n\n## Step 1: Define Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **NPV of Lifetime Earnings** | Present value of all future earnings minus costs, discounted at 5% | 20 years post-decision |\n| **Career Optionality Score** | Number of meaningfully distinct career paths accessible (weighted by desirability) | 10 years |\n| **Risk-Adjusted Satisfaction** | Composite of compensation, autonomy, intellectual engagement, stress (1-10 scale) | 5-year average |\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Options (Including Unmentioned)\n\n1. **Enroll in MBA full-time** (as proposed)\n2. **Stay in SWE, no MBA** (status quo)\n3. **Stay in SWE + pursue part-time/executive MBA** (hybrid)\n4. **Stay in SWE, aggressively job-hop / FAANG-target** (career acceleration without MBA)\n5. **Defer MBA 1-2 years** (gain more experience, stronger post-MBA placement)\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: NPV of Incremental Earnings over 20 Years (vs. doing nothing baseline)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Key Assumptions |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n| **Full-time MBA** | +$250K | (-$200K to +$900K) | Total cost ~$420K (tuition $160K + $260K foregone earnings). Post-MBA comp ~$180-210K starting, trajectory depends on exit. |\n| **Stay in SWE (status quo)** | $0 (baseline) | \u2014 | SWE salary grows to ~$200-280K by year 10 at strong companies |\n| **Part-time MBA** | +$100K | (-$50K to +$350K) | Tuition ~$120K, no foregone earnings, weaker recruiting signal |\n| **Aggressive job-hop (no MBA)** | +$150K | (-$50K to +$500K) | FAANG/unicorn targeting, $200K+ by year 5, no tuition costs |\n| **Defer 1-2 years** | +$350K | (-$100K to +$1M) | More experience \u2192 better placement, one more year of earnings, stronger network leverage |\n\n### KPI 2: Career Optionality (distinct accessible paths, 1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **Full-time MBA** | 8.5 | (7, 10) |\n| **Stay in SWE** | 4 | (3, 6) |\n| **Part-time MBA** | 6 | (4.5, 7.5) |\n| **Aggressive job-hop** | 5 | (3.5, 6.5) |\n| **Defer MBA** | 9 | (7.5, 10) |\n\n*MBA uniquely unlocks: management consulting, PE/VC, corporate strategy, product leadership, entrepreneurial networks. These are genuinely hard to access from pure SWE.*\n\n### KPI 3: Risk-Adjusted Satisfaction (1-10, 5-year avg)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **Full-time MBA** | 7.5 | (5.5, 9) |\n| **Stay in SWE** | 6 | (4.5, 7.5) |\n| **Part-time MBA** | 6.5 | (5, 8) |\n| **Aggressive job-hop** | 6.5 | (4, 8) |\n| **Defer MBA** | 7.5 | (5.5, 9) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **Median MBA salary premium over career**: ~$500K-$1.5M lifetime, but this includes selection bias \u2014 MBA admits would have earned more anyway. **Causal premium estimated at roughly 50-60% of the raw gap** (Arcidiacono et al., various studies).\n- **Top-15 MBA post-graduation median comp**: ~$175-210K total (GSB/HBS/Wharton higher). Source: school employment reports.\n- **SWE with 3 years experience, 10-year comp trajectory without MBA**: $200-350K+ at FAANG/top-tier. Senior/Staff engineers can hit $350-500K+.\n- **MBA graduate career satisfaction**: ~80% report \"worth it\" in alumni surveys, but **survivorship and justification bias are enormous** here.\n- **Percentage of MBA grads who switch careers entirely post-MBA**: ~60-70% at top programs \u2014 this is the real signal for optionality value.\n- **SWE\u2192MBA pipeline specifically**: Tech-background MBAs are among the highest-earning post-MBA cohorts (product management, tech strategy, VC). This is a tailwind for you.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Sunk cost avoidance disguised as opportunity** | \"I got in\" creates urgency. Admission is not a reason to go \u2014 it's a reason to *evaluate*. |\n| **Anchoring on sticker price** | $160K tuition is salient, but the larger cost is **$260K+ in foregone earnings**. True cost is ~$420K+. Many framings underweight this. |\n| **Prestige bias / social proof** | \"Good MBA program\" triggers status heuristics. The *specific program rank* matters enormously (Top 7 vs. Top 25 is a different decision entirely). |\n| **Neglect of the counterfactual** | The question frames it as MBA vs. nothing. But the real question is MBA vs. *the best alternative use of those 2 years and $420K*. |\n| **Narrow framing** | Binary yes/no ignores defer, part-time, or \"go but pivot to VC/PM\" as distinct strategies within the MBA option. |\n| **Present bias** | Two years feels long now. Over a 30-year career, it's noise. People systematically overweight the near-term cost. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Key Conditional: What program exactly, and what do you want?\n\n**If this is a Top-7 program (HSW, Booth, Kellogg, Sloan, CBS):**\n\n> **Go, but consider deferring 1 year if the program allows it.** The expected value is positive across all three KPIs. The optionality value alone \u2014 access to consulting, VC, product leadership, entrepreneurship networks \u2014 justifies the cost for someone uncertain about staying in pure SWE forever. Your SWE background is a *strong differentiator* in MBA recruiting.\n\n**Expected value: +$250K to +$400K NPV, with massive optionality upside.**\n\n**If this is a program ranked 10-25:**\n\n> **Seriously consider the aggressive job-hop alternative or the part-time option.** The NPV calculus gets much tighter, recruiting access narrows, and the foregone SWE earnings are the same. The confidence interval on financial returns goes substantially negative.\n\n### Critical Question You Must Answer First\n\n> *\"Am I going because I want to leave engineering, or because I think I should want to?\"*\n\nIf you love building software and want to be a Staff/Principal engineer, the MBA is **negative EV**. If you want to lead organizations, enter investing, or start a company and want the network, **it's strongly positive EV at a top program.**\n\n**Bottom line: Conditionally recommended. The program tier and your career *goal* (not just dissatisfaction) are the dominant variables, not the tuition.**",
