  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: **Not yet. But don't ignore the signal.**\n\nHere's how I'd think through this step by step.\n\n---\n\n## First, the questions that actually matter\n\nBefore the build/don't-build decision, you need clarity on things I don't know:\n\n- **How many of your 200 customers are asking?** If it's 8 vocal ones, that's 4%. If it's 80, that's a different conversation.\n- **What specifically are they trying to do on mobile?** Check dashboards? Approve workflows? Get notifications? The use case matters enormously.\n- **Is anyone churning or failing to close because of this?** \"Would be nice\" vs. \"this is a blocker\" are completely different.\n- **What's your ARR and runway?** $200K means very different things at $1M ARR vs. $10M ARR.\n\n---\n\n## My default recommendation: **Optimize the mobile web experience first**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n### The case against building native right now\n\n- **$200K + 4 months is the optimistic estimate.** Real cost includes ongoing maintenance, app store management, two platforms, version compatibility, and a second deployment pipeline. Year-one total cost is probably closer to $300-350K.\n- **200 customers is a small base to justify a native app.** The per-customer cost of this investment is $1,000+ each, before maintenance.\n- **\"Users are asking for an app\" often really means \"your mobile experience is bad.\"** They're diagnosing and prescribing at the same time. The actual problem may be simpler.\n- **You'll split engineering focus.** For a company your size, that's a real cost that doesn't show up in the $200K estimate.\n\n### What I'd do instead (Phase 1 \u2014 4 to 6 weeks, ~$30-50K)\n\n1. **Talk to the 10 most vocal requesters.** Understand the actual jobs-to-be-done on mobile.\n2. **Build a responsive, mobile-optimized version of just those workflows.** Not the whole app. Just the 2-3 things people actually need on a phone.\n3. **Add push notifications via a PWA (Progressive Web App)** if notifications are a key need \u2014 this closes the biggest gap without an app store.\n4. **Measure actual mobile usage** after improvements.\n\n### Then reassess (Phase 2)\n\nIf after optimization you see that:\n- Mobile usage is growing significantly\n- Customers still need native capabilities (offline access, deep OS integration, camera/GPS)\n- You're losing deals specifically because of no native app\n\n...then build the native app **with confidence that you're solving a validated problem**, and you'll already know which features to prioritize.\n\n---\n\n## The exception \u2014 when I'd say build it now\n\nIf any of these are true, move straight to native:\n\n- **Enterprise deals are stalling** because \"no mobile app\" is failing security/procurement checklists\n- **Your competitors all have native apps** and it's showing up in every loss analysis\n- **The core value of your product requires offline access or hardware features** (camera, GPS, Bluetooth)\n- **You have the cash and team bandwidth** where $200K doesn't represent a meaningful tradeoff against other priorities\n\n---\n\n## Bottom line\n\nThe \"should we build an app\" question is really three questions:\n\n| Question | How to answer |\n|---|---|\n| Is there a real mobile problem? | Almost certainly yes |\n| Is a native app the right solution? | Probably not yet |\n| Should you invest in mobile? | **Yes, absolutely \u2014 but start with the web** |\n\nThe smartest move is to **spend $40K solving 80% of the problem first**, learn from real usage data, and then make the $200K decision with evidence instead of assumptions.\n\nWhat does the breakdown of customer requests actually look like? I can help you think through the next layer if you share more detail.",
