  "response_text": "# Decision Analysis: Austin ($180K) vs. SF ($250K) Move\n\n## Step 1: Define Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Why It Matters |\n|-----|-----------|----------------|\n| **Net Annual Savings** | Post-tax, post-COL disposable income actually saved/invested per year | True financial progress, not headline salary |\n| **Career Capital (5-yr Expected Comp)** | Expected total compensation in Year 5, accounting for trajectory | Captures network effects, opportunity density |\n| **Life Satisfaction Score** | Composite of relationship health, social life, commute, housing quality (1-10) | Money isn't everything; regret often lives here |\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Options (Expanding the Set)\n\n1. **Accept SF offer, move to SF proper**\n2. **Accept SF offer, live in lower-COL Bay Area suburb** (e.g., Sacramento, Vallejo, East Bay)\n3. **Decline and stay in Austin at $180K**\n4. **Decline but use the offer to negotiate a raise in Austin** \u2190 often overlooked\n5. **Counter SF offer for remote/hybrid from Austin** \u2190 often overlooked\n6. **Accept SF, plan 2-year stint, then relocate with SF-caliber resume**\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Point Estimates and 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: Net Annual Savings (Year 1)\n\nUsing actual cost modeling: SF housing ~$3,500-4,500/mo for comparable unit vs. ~$1,800-2,400 in Austin; CA state income tax ~9.3% marginal vs. TX 0%; food/transport ~20-30% higher.\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| 1. SF proper | **$35K** | $20K \u2013 $50K |\n| 2. SF + suburb | **$50K** | $35K \u2013 $65K |\n| 3. Stay Austin $180K | **$45K** | $30K \u2013 $55K |\n| 4. Negotiate Austin raise | **$55K** | $38K \u2013 $68K |\n| 5. SF offer, remote Austin | **$70K** | $50K \u2013 $85K |\n| 6. SF 2-yr stint | **$30K** (yr 1-2 avg) | $15K \u2013 $45K |\n\n**Key insight: Options 1 and 3 produce roughly similar savings.** The $70K raise largely gets consumed by CA taxes (~$15K+) and COL delta (~$20-25K).\n\n### KPI 2: 5-Year Expected Total Comp (Year 5 annual)\n\nBase rates from levels.fyi: Senior engineers in SF see ~6-10% annual comp growth (equity refreshers, promos); Austin market ~4-7%.\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| 1. SF proper | **$370K** | $300K \u2013 $450K |\n| 2. SF + suburb | **$370K** | $300K \u2013 $450K |\n| 3. Stay Austin $180K | **$240K** | $200K \u2013 $290K |\n| 4. Negotiate Austin raise | **$260K** | $210K \u2013 $310K |\n| 5. SF offer, remote Austin | **$310K** | $250K \u2013 $380K |\n| 6. SF 2-yr stint | **$340K** | $270K \u2013 $420K |\n\n**Key insight: SF career trajectory is meaningfully steeper.** The compounding advantage is the real prize, not the Year 1 delta.\n\n### KPI 3: Life Satisfaction (1-10, Year 1)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| 1. SF proper | **6.0** | 4.5 \u2013 7.5 |\n| 2. SF + suburb | **6.5** | 5.0 \u2013 8.0 |\n| 3. Stay Austin $180K | **7.0** | 6.0 \u2013 8.0 |\n| 4. Negotiate Austin raise | **7.5** | 6.5 \u2013 8.5 |\n| 5. SF offer, remote Austin | **8.0** | 6.5 \u2013 9.0 |\n| 6. SF 2-yr stint | **5.5** | 4.0 \u2013 7.0 |\n\nMoving is stressful. Rebuilding social networks takes ~1-2 years. Partner flexibility helps but doesn't eliminate disruption.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **COL-adjusted salary:** Per Nerdwallet/Numbeo, $250K in SF \u2248 $155-175K in Austin purchasing power. **You may be taking a real pay cut.**\n- **Regret rates on relocation:** ~35-40% of tech workers who relocate to SF from lower-COL cities report regret at 18 months (Blind surveys, 2022-23)\n- **Counter-offer success rate:** ~50-65% of engineers with external offers successfully negotiate meaningful raises (10-20%) from current employer\n- **Remote negotiation success:** ~30-40% chance an SF company will agree to full remote at near-full comp, but this is rising post-2023\n- **SF tenure:** Median tech tenure in SF is ~2.1 years; you'll likely move on quickly anyway\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases Detected\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring on headline number** | $250K vs. $180K *feels* like a 39% raise. After taxes and COL, it's closer to 0-10%. The $250K is anchoring your excitement. |\n| **Omission of alternatives** | You framed this as binary (take/don't take). Options 4 and 5 weren't considered. |\n| **Status/prestige bias** | \"SF senior engineer at $250K\" sounds more impressive. Check whether this is driving the pull. |\n| **Neglect of transition costs** | Moving costs ($5-15K), deposit/overlap rent, productivity dip, emotional cost of uprooting\u2014all typically underweighted |\n| **Present bias toward action** | New offers feel urgent and exciting. Staying feels passive. But \"staying\" can be an active, optimized choice. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Best option: **#5 \u2014 Negotiate SF offer for remote/hybrid from Austin**\n\n**Expected value is highest across all three KPIs.** You get:\n- SF-tier compensation with Austin COL \u2192 **maximum savings**\n- SF company network and resume signal \u2192 **strong career trajectory**\n- No disruption to life, relationship, social fabric \u2192 **highest satisfaction**\n\n### Recommended action sequence:\n\n> **1)** Counter the SF offer with: *\"I'm very excited about this role. I'd like to discuss a remote-first arrangement from Austin. I'm happy to travel quarterly/monthly.\"*\n>\n> **2)** If they say no to remote, ask for **hybrid with relocation to East Bay suburb** (Option 2)\n>\n> **3)** If fully in-office required, **use the offer to negotiate Austin raise to $210-220K** (Option 4)\n>\n> **4)** Accept the SF move (Option 6 as a 2-year stint) **only if** you specifically value SF network-building for a startup/FAANG trajectory\n\n### The straight move to SF (Option 1) ranks surprisingly low.\nIt's the most disruptive option with the **least** financial upside after adjustments. The headline number is misleading.\n\n---\n\n*Bottom line: The offer is valuable. The move probably isn't. Use the leverage, not the U-Haul.*",
