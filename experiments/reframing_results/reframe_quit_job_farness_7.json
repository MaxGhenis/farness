  "response_text": "# Decision Analysis: Leave Google for Developer Tools Startup\n\n## Step 1: Define Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **Financial Outcome (NPV)** | Net present value of expected earnings minus costs over 5 years, discounted at 8% | 5 years |\n| **Career Capital** | Composite: marketable skills + network + optionality (scored 1-100 relative to current trajectory) | 5 years |\n| **Life Satisfaction** | Self-reported fulfillment score (1-10) weighted across work meaning, family stability, stress, autonomy | Ongoing |\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Identify Full Option Set\n\nMost people frame this as binary. It isn't.\n\n| # | Option |\n|---|--------|\n| **A** | Stay at Google, shelve the idea |\n| **B** | Stay at Google, build nights/weekends (moonlight) |\n| **C** | Take a leave of absence (Google offers up to 12 weeks unpaid; some PMs negotiate longer) |\n| **D** | Quit and go full-time, self-funded |\n| **E** | Quit and go full-time, raise pre-seed first |\n| **F** | Transition to part-time/contract while building |\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: 5-Year Financial NPV ($K)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| **A** Stay | **$1,500K** | $1,300 \u2013 $1,800 | Stable comp w/ likely promotion to Sr PM/Director |\n| **B** Moonlight | **$1,400K** | $1,200 \u2013 $1,700 | Slight performance drag; startup revenue unlikely to be material in this mode |\n| **C** Leave of Absence | **$1,250K** | $900 \u2013 $1,600 | 3-month gap costs ~$87K; return option preserves most upside |\n| **D** Quit, self-fund | **$450K** | **-$150 \u2013 $1,800** | Expected value dragged down by ~90% failure rate; upside tail is real but thin |\n| **E** Quit, raise pre-seed | **$550K** | -$50 \u2013 $2,200 | Dilution costs something, but external capital extends runway and validates idea |\n| **F** Part-time/contract | **$900K** | $500 \u2013 $1,400 | Reduced salary (~$150-200K contract rate) + startup optionality |\n\n### KPI 2: Career Capital (1-100)\n\n| Option | Point Est. | 80% CI |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| **A** | 70 | 65\u201378 |\n| **B** | 72 | 63\u201380 |\n| **C** | 75 | 65\u201385 |\n| **D** | 68 | 40\u201395 |\n| **E** | 72 | 45\u201395 |\n| **F** | 70 | 50\u201385 |\n\n*Note: Startup experience is high-variance \u2014 failure teaches a lot but can narrow re-entry options if prolonged.*\n\n### KPI 3: Life Satisfaction (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Est. | 80% CI |\n|--------|-----------|--------|\n| **A** | 5.5 | 4\u20137 |\n| **B** | 5.0 | 3.5\u20136.5 |\n| **C** | 7.0 | 5.5\u20138.5 |\n| **D** | 6.5 | 3\u20139 |\n| **E** | 6.5 | 3\u20139 |\n| **F** | 6.5 | 4.5\u20138 |\n\n*B scores lowest because the dual-load with a 2-year-old is brutal \u2014 this is the \"worst of both worlds\" trap.*\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Statistic | Source / Basis |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| **~90% of funded startups fail** | CB Insights, Crunchbase longitudinal data |\n| **~95%+ of self-funded startups fail to reach $1M ARR** | Indie Hackers surveys, MicroConf data |\n| **Developer tools median time to product-market fit: 18-24 months** | a16z, Heavybit portfolio data |\n| **Median pre-seed runway: 12-18 months** | Carta data, 2023 |\n| **Your $200K savings = ~12 months runway** (family burn in HCOL ~$12-15K/mo) | Implied from your situation |\n| **Google PM re-hire probability within 2 years: ~60-70%** | Anecdotal but strong for ex-Googlers with good standing |\n| **Regret rates for NOT pursuing entrepreneurship: high** | Bronnie Ware end-of-life research; specific founder survey data from Kauffman Foundation |\n| **Developer tools VC funding down ~40% from 2021 peak** | PitchBook 2024 data |\n\n**Critical base rate:** Your $200K gives you roughly **12-14 months** of family runway with a working spouse. The median devtools startup takes 18-24 months to find PMF. **You are structurally under-capitalized for a full quit without fundraising.**\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Binary framing** | You asked \"should I quit or not\" \u2014 ignoring 4 other options |\n| **Passion bias / affect heuristic** | \"I'm passionate about\" is doing heavy emotional lifting; passion is uncorrelated with startup success (Gartner research) |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | $350K/yr is ~$29K/mo \u2014 every month of startup is a $29K bet; this is often under-felt |\n| **Survivorship bias** | The founder stories you're inspired by are the 5-10% that worked |\n| **Status quo bias** (counteracting) | Your framing suggests you *want* to leave, so this may be weaker than usual |\n| **Anchoring on savings** | $200K *feels* like a lot of money; it is not a lot of startup runway for a family |\n| **Underweighting the 2-year-old** | Children 2-4 are the highest-demand parenting years; stress compounds non-linearly |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Recommended: **Option C \u2192 E pipeline (Leave of Absence \u2192 Raise, then Quit)**\n\n**Rationale by expected value:**\n\n**Do this sequence:**\n\n1. **Months 1-2 (now):** While still at Google, validate demand. Talk to 30+ developers. Get 5 LOIs or design partners. This costs you evenings but is time-bounded.\n\n2. **Month 3:** If signal is strong, negotiate a **leave of absence** from Google. Frame it as personal/family \u2014 3 months is standard, some negotiate 6.\n\n3. **During leave:** Build an MVP and simultaneously pitch pre-seed investors. Developer tools investors (Heavybit, Greylock, Redpoint) move fast when there's a credible ex-Google PM with early traction.\n\n4. **Decision gate at end of leave:**\n   - **If you have a term sheet or strong early traction:** Resign and go full-time (Option E)\n   - **If not:** Return to Google with zero financial damage and critical information gained\n\n**Why this dominates Option D (just quitting):**\n\n| Metric | Option D (Quit now) | Option C\u2192E (Staged) |\n|--------|---------------------|----------------------|\n| Financial downside | -$150K possible | Limited to leave period (~$60-90K) |\n| Information value | You learn by burning cash | You learn before burning cash |\n| Fundraising leverage | \"I quit my job\" (desperate energy) | \"I'm at Google and have traction\" (leverage) |\n| Family stress | Immediate, high | Graduated, manageable |\n| Reversibility | Low | High |\n\n### The math that matters:\n\nThe expected value difference between D and C\u2192E is approximately **+$200-400K** in the financial KPI alone, driven almost entirely by **preserving optionality** and **reducing the cost of the failure scenario** (which is the 85-90% probability outcome).\n\n### When you SHOULD just quit (Option D):\n\n- You've already validated with paying customers\n- You have a co-founder with complementary skills\n- You have $500K+ in savings or a term sheet in hand\n- Your spouse's income fully covers family expenses\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n> **Don't confuse courage with recklessness.** The founders who win are usually the ones who de-risked intelligently before going all-in. Your passion is an asset \u2014 protect it by not putting yourself in a financial position where stress kills it within 12 months. Stage your commitment, let the evidence guide the jump, and you'll either build something real or return to Google knowing you tested it honestly.",
