Options C-F are often superior and routinely overlooked.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Point Estimates and 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: Financial Outcome (5-Year NPV vs. Staying)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 Quit now | **-$450K** | (-$1.2M, +$2M) |\n| B \u2014 Stay | **$0** (baseline) | (-$100K, +$200K) |\n| C \u2014 Moonlight then decide | **-$80K** | (-$500K, +$1.5M) |\n| D \u2014 Leave of absence | **-$150K** | (-$600K, +$1.8M) |\n| E \u2014 Reduce hours, build | **-$60K** | (-$300K, +$1.2M) |\n| F \u2014 Cofounder goes first | **-$30K** | (-$400K, +$1.0M) |\n\n**Key assumptions:** Option A burns ~$200K savings + $350K\u00d72yr opportunity cost before most startups reach clarity. The fat right tail exists but is thin.\n\n### KPI 2: Career Capital (1-10 at year 5)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 Quit now | **6.5** | (4, 9) |\n| B \u2014 Stay | **7.0** | (6, 8) |\n| C \u2014 Moonlight then decide | **7.5** | (6, 9) |\n| D \u2014 Leave of absence | **7.5** | (5.5, 9) |\n| E \u2014 Reduce hours, build | **7.0** | (6, 8.5) |\n| F \u2014 Cofounder goes first | **7.0** | (5.5, 8.5) |\n\n**Note:** A failed startup at your level is *not* career-destroying (Google rehires, other FAANG will take you), but a 2-year gap does compress re-entry comp ~10-15%.\n\n### KPI 3: Life Satisfaction (1-10 at year 3)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 Quit now | **6.0** | (3, 9) |\n| B \u2014 Stay | **5.5** | (4, 7) |\n| C \u2014 Moonlight then decide | **5.5** | (4, 7.5) |\n| D \u2014 Leave of absence | **6.5** | (4.5, 8.5) |\n| E \u2014 Reduce hours, build | **5.5** | (4, 7) |\n| F \u2014 Cofounder goes first | **5.5** | (4, 7) |\n\n**Note on Option A satisfaction:** The variance is enormous. Founders with a 2-year-old and a depleting savings account report *both* the highest highs and lowest lows. Financial stress is the #1 cited cause of startup founder divorce.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Statistic | Source / Estimate |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| Developer tools startups reaching $1M ARR within 3 years | **~5-8%** of funded, ~2-4% of bootstrapped |\n| First-time founders who return to employment within 2 years | **~60-70%** (Carta data, various accelerator reports) |\n| Solo founders vs. teams reaching Series A | Solo founders: **~1/3 the rate** of 2-3 person teams (Y Combinator data) |\n| Startups started as side projects that successfully transitioned | **Higher survival rate** than cold-start quits \u2014 ~1.5-2\u00d7 (Wadhwa et al.) |\n| Google employees who take LOA and return | **~70%** return; ~30% convert to full startup commitment (anecdotal, ex-Googler communities) |\n| Savings runway at your burn rate ($350K lifestyle + $200K savings) | **~8-14 months** before financial stress becomes acute (assuming spouse covers ~50% of household) |\n| Median time to product-market fit, dev tools | **18-30 months** (OpenView Partners data) |\n\n**Critical mismatch:** Your runway (8-14 months) is shorter than median time-to-PMF (18-30 months). This is the single most important number in this analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **False binary framing** | \"Should I quit or not\" ignores Options C-F. This is the most consequential bias present. |\n| **Passion bias / affect heuristic** | \"I'm passionate about\" front-loads emotion. Passion is necessary but uncorrelated with startup success (Gielnik et al., 2015). |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | $350K/yr is ~$30K/month. Every month of startup work implicitly costs this. People chronically underweight this because it's invisible. |\n| **Survivorship bias** | The founders you admire who \"just quit\" are visible; the hundreds who quietly returned to employment are not. |\n| **Present bias** | The 2-year-old will be more expensive and more emotionally demanding at 3-4. Financial pressure compounds non-linearly with family obligations. |\n| **Overconfidence in idea stage** | You describe an *idea*, not validated demand. Base rates for pre-validation ideas converting to real businesses are much lower than for ideas with LOIs or waitlist signals. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation Based on Expected Value\n\n### Ranking by weighted expected value\n*(Weighting: 40% Financial, 25% Career Capital, 35% Life Satisfaction)*\n\n| Rank | Option | Weighted EV Score |\n|------|--------|------------------|\n| **1** | **D \u2014 Leave of absence** | Highest. Preserves optionality, gives real full-time signal, Google safety net. |\n| **2** | **C \u2014 Moonlight 6-12 months, then decide** | Close second. Lower variance, lets you validate before burning runway. |\n| **3** | **F \u2014 Cofounder goes full-time first** | Good if you can find the right person. De-risks your family's position. |\n| **4** | **A \u2014 Quit now** | High variance. Only optimal if the idea is *already partially validated* (which isn't indicated). |\n| **5** | **E \u2014 Reduce hours** | Moderate. Hard to execute in practice at Google. |\n| **6** | **B \u2014 Stay, abandon idea** | Lowest regret-adjusted satisfaction long-term. |\n\n---\n\n### **Primary Recommendation: Option D \u2192 A (Staged)**\n\n> **Pursue a leave of absence from Google (6-12 months).** Use months 1-2 to validate: build an MVP and get 5-10 paying design partners or a waitlist of 200+. If you hit those milestones, resign and commit. If you don't, return with zero career damage and critical information gained.\n\n**Why this dominates quitting now:**\n- Same upside (you go full-time if it's working)\n- Dramatically lower downside (no career gap, no savings depletion on an unvalidated idea)\n- Resolves the **runway < time-to-PMF mismatch** by letting you validate *before* the clock starts\n\n**If LOA is unavailable:**\nDefault to **Option C** \u2014 moonlight seriously for 6 months with explicit go/no-go milestones written down *today* (e.g., \"10 companies on waitlist by Month 4 or I stop\").\n\n### One Non-Negotiable Regardless of Path\nWrite down your **kill criteria** now, before passion and sunk cost take over. The most expensive mistake isn't starting \u2014 it's continuing 6 months too long.",
