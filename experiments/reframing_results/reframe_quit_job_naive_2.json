  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your Startup Decision\n\nThis is a genuinely hard decision, and I want to be honest with you rather than just cheerleading.\n\n## What I'd actually recommend: **Not yet. But take concrete steps to force a real decision within 6 months.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n## The honest financial picture\n\n- $350K/year is roughly $20K+/month after tax\n- $200K in savings sounds like a lot, but with a family in a GOOG-cost-of-living area, that's maybe **10-12 months of runway** if you're disciplined\n- That's not much runway. Most developer tools companies take 18-24 months to find real traction\n- Your spouse's income helps but probably doesn't fully replace yours\n\n**The math is tight.** Not impossible, but tight.\n\n## What actually concerns me\n\n**You haven't mentioned the things that matter most:**\n\n- Do you have paying customers or strong signals of demand?\n- Have you built anything yet?\n- Do you have a cofounder?\n- Have you talked to 50+ potential users?\n\nIf the answer to most of these is \"no,\" you're not choosing between your job and your startup. **You're choosing between your job and an untested idea.** Those are very different things.\n\n## What I'd do in your position\n\n### Months 1-3: Validate ruthlessly while employed\n- Talk to 30-50 developers about the problem\n- Build a prototype on nights/weekends (yes, it's hard with a 2-year-old - that's also data about your commitment level)\n- Get design partners or waitlist signups\n- Check your employment agreement regarding side projects\n\n### Month 4-5: Assess honestly\n- Is there real pull, or are you just getting polite encouragement?\n- Can you get a LOI or early revenue?\n- Have you found a cofounder?\n\n### Month 6: Make the real decision\n- If you have evidence of demand, quit with conviction\n- If you don't, either the idea needs to change or this isn't the right venture\n\n## The uncomfortable truths\n\n**In favor of waiting:**\n- Developer tools is a crowded space. Passion isn't differentiation.\n- Google PM experience gives you credibility that actually *increases* over time for fundraising\n- Your 2-year-old won't remember this year, but the financial stress could affect your marriage\n- Most people who quit to \"explore an idea\" burn savings and end up back in a job with less leverage\n\n**In favor of going now:**\n- You will never feel ready\n- Nights-and-weekends mode produces nights-and-weekends results\n- If you're senior enough for $350K, you can likely get re-hired if it fails\n- The golden handcuffs only get heavier as compensation grows\n\n## The thing nobody says\n\nThe real risk isn't financial failure. It's that you spend 2 years in a comfortable job \"validating on the side,\" never fully commit, the idea slowly dies, and at 45 you're still at Google wondering \"what if.\"\n\n**Set a decision deadline. Make it real. Tell your spouse the date.**\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Your situation is survivable but not comfortable for a leap right now. Give yourself 3-6 months to turn \"idea I'm passionate about\" into \"opportunity with evidence\" \u2014 then make the jump with real conviction and a better chance of success.\n\nThe worst outcome isn't failing at a startup. It's perpetually almost starting one.",
