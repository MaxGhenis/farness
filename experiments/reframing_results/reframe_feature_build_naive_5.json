  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: Not yet. Do smaller steps first.\n\nHere's my reasoning, and I'll flag where I'm making assumptions you should check.\n\n## The core question isn't \"should we build it?\" \u2014 it's \"what problem are we actually solving?\"\n\n\"Users have been asking for it\" is the most dangerous input for product decisions. Let me explain why, and what to do instead.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd do before committing $200K\n\n### 1. Quantify the actual demand\n- How many of your 200 customers asked? If it's 15, that's 7.5%. If it's 80, that's different.\n- Are these your highest-value customers? Or your most vocal ones?\n- **What specifically do they want to do on mobile?** This matters enormously. \"Check a dashboard on the go\" is a very different problem than \"do core workflows on mobile.\"\n\n### 2. Try the cheap thing first\nA **responsive web app / PWA optimization** might take 2-4 weeks and $15-30K. This would tell you:\n- Do people actually use it on mobile when you make it usable?\n- What features do they reach for?\n- If usage is low even after optimization, a native app won't fix that\n\n### 3. Pressure-test the business case\nAsk yourself honestly:\n\n| Question | If yes \u2192 leans toward build | If no \u2192 wait |\n|---|---|---|\n| Are you losing deals because no mobile app? | Real revenue signal | Proceed with caution |\n| Is churn linked to mobile gaps? | Retention problem worth solving | Lower priority |\n| Do competitors have native apps customers are comparing you to? | Market pressure is real | You have time |\n| Are your customers in the field (sales, services, logistics)? | Mobile is core to their workflow | Nice-to-have, not need-to-have |\n| Is $200K less than 5% of your ARR? | You can afford the bet | This is a big bet for your stage |\n\n---\n\n## My honest concerns with building now\n\n**$200K and 4 months is the optimistic estimate.** In my experience, native app projects at this stage tend to run 1.5-2x on both time and cost. So budget mentally for $300K and 6 months.\n\n**You now have two platforms to maintain forever.** This isn't a one-time cost \u2014 it's an ongoing tax on your engineering team. Every feature ships slower because it ships twice.\n\n**At 200 customers, you're still finding product-market fit refinements.** A native app locks in assumptions about workflows that you may want to change.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually recommend\n\n**Phase 1 (now, 3-4 weeks):** Optimize your web app for mobile. Make it genuinely good on mobile browsers. Measure adoption.\n\n**Phase 2 (weeks 4-8):** Talk to the 10 loudest mobile-requesters. Show them the improved mobile web. Ask: *\"What's still missing?\"* Their answers tell you whether native capabilities (push notifications, offline access, camera, etc.) are actually needed.\n\n**Phase 3 (if validated):** Build the native app, but now you know exactly what features matter, so you can scope a smarter v1 that might cost less and ship faster.\n\n---\n\n## Where I might be wrong\n\n- If you're in a segment where \"we have a mobile app\" is literally a checkbox on RFP requirements, the business case is simpler and more immediate\n- If your competitors just shipped mobile apps and you're getting direct comparison pressure, speed matters more than perfect validation\n- If a few very large customers are asking and they represent significant revenue concentration, their requests carry more weight than the numbers suggest\n\n**The bottom line:** I'd spend $20-30K on mobile web optimization first, measure what happens, then make the $200K decision with real data instead of request volume. You'll likely still build the app eventually \u2014 but you'll build a better one.\n\nWhat does the demand actually look like when you break it down? That would change my recommendation significantly.",
