  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: Not yet \u2014 but don't dismiss it either.\n\nHere's how I'd think through this systematically:\n\n## First, the questions that actually determine the answer\n\nBefore spending $200K, you need clarity on things I'd want to probe:\n\n**How many users are actually asking?**\n- \"Users have been asking\" could mean 5 loud voices or 120 consistent requests. There's a massive difference. If you don't have a count, that's your first step.\n\n**What are they actually trying to do on mobile?**\n- Check dashboards/status? \u2192 A responsive web redesign might solve this.\n- Approve workflows on the go? \u2192 That's a stronger native app case.\n- Do full desktop-equivalent work? \u2192 They'll be disappointed with a native app too.\n\n**Is it blocking deals or causing churn?**\n- \"It would be nice\" \u2260 \"we're choosing your competitor because of this\"\n- Talk to your sales team and check lost-deal reasons.\n\n## Why I'd lean against building it *right now*\n\n**The math is tough at 200 customers.** $200K is $1,000 per customer. Unless mobile access directly drives expansion revenue or is causing measurable churn, that capital probably has higher-ROI uses.\n\n**4 months is optimistic.** Native apps come with ongoing costs people underestimate: app store reviews, OS version updates, a second deployment pipeline, push notification infrastructure, and feature parity maintenance. The real cost is probably $200K in year one and $60-100K/year ongoing.\n\n**You have a cheaper option you haven't fully explored.** Making your web app responsive and mobile-optimized is likely 4-6 weeks and $30-50K. For most B2B use cases, this closes 70-80% of the gap.\n\n## What I'd actually do\n\n**Phase 1 (now, ~$40K):** Invest in making your web app properly responsive. Add it as a PWA (Progressive Web App) so users can \"install\" it on their home screen, get some offline capability, and receive push notifications.\n\n**Phase 2 (parallel):** Instrument the mobile web usage. Now you'll have real data on *what people actually do* on mobile, not what they say they'd do.\n\n**Phase 3 (decision point in ~3 months):** With real mobile usage data, you can make the native app decision with evidence. If mobile usage is high and users are hitting genuine limitations of the browser, build it. You'll also know *which features* to prioritize rather than guessing.\n\n## The exception \u2014 when I'd say build it now\n\nIf any of these are true, move faster:\n\n- You're losing competitive deals specifically over this\n- You're moving upmarket and enterprise buyers have it on their security/procurement checklist\n- Your core use case is inherently mobile (field teams, frontline workers, etc.)\n- You have the cash and runway where $200K is a small bet\n\n## Bottom line\n\n**The request for a \"mobile app\" is usually a proxy for \"your product is painful to use on my phone.\"** Solve that problem first with the cheapest solution. If that's not enough, you'll know quickly \u2014 and you'll build a better native app because of what you learned.\n\nThe worst outcome is spending $200K and 4+ months building a native app that gets 15% adoption because the actual need was simpler than you assumed.",
