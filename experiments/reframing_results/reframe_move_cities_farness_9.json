Austin $180K \u2192 ~$135K after TX tax (no state income tax); rent ~$1,800/mo ($22K). SF COL ~45-50% higher eats most of the gap |\n| SF (suburb/East Bay) | **$40K** | $20K \u2013 $55K | Rent drops to ~$2,200-2,800; some commute cost |\n| Stay Austin $180K | **$45K** | $30K \u2013 $60K | No state income tax is massive; established low-cost lifestyle |\n| Negotiate Austin raise | **$55K** | $35K \u2013 $70K | Realistic counter: $200-215K using SF offer as leverage; TX tax advantage preserved |\n| Counter for remote from Austin | **$50K** | $25K \u2013 $65K | They may offer $210-230K remote-adjusted; you keep Austin COL |\n| Broad job search | **$45K** | $15K \u2013 $70K | Highest variance; depends on outcome |\n\n### Career Capital at Year 5 (Total Comp)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| SF (city/suburb) | **$350K** | $280K \u2013 $450K | SF network effects are real; proximity to HQ, visibility, stronger promotion pipeline at most tech cos |\n| Stay Austin $180K | **$240K** | $200K \u2013 $300K | Austin tech scene is growing but ceiling is lower for many ladders |\n| Negotiate Austin raise | **$260K** | $210K \u2013 $320K | Better starting point, same ceiling constraints |\n| Remote from Austin | **$290K** | $230K \u2013 $370K | Get on SF company's ladder but remote employees face documented promotion penalty |\n| Broad search | **$300K** | $200K \u2013 $420K | High variance |\n\n### Life Satisfaction (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| SF (city) | **6.5** | 5.0 \u2013 8.0 | Excitement of new city, but partner uprooting, smaller living space, losing Austin community. Adjustment stress is real |\n| SF (suburb) | **6.0** | 4.5 \u2013 7.5 | Commute fatigue erodes satisfaction; less of the \"SF upside\" |\n| Stay Austin | **7.0** | 6.0 \u2013 8.0 | Stability, established relationships, but possible regret/stagnation |\n| Negotiate raise | **7.5** | 6.5 \u2013 8.5 | Best of both worlds *if* it works; risk of souring relationship with employer |\n| Remote from Austin | **7.5** | 6.0 \u2013 8.5 | Career growth + lifestyle stability; risk of \"out of sight, out of mind\" |\n| Broad search | **6.0** | 4.0 \u2013 8.0 | Search process itself is draining |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **COL-adjusted purchasing power**: The BEA Regional Price Parities index shows SF is ~1.49x the national average vs Austin at ~1.03x. That's a **45% gap**, meaning $250K in SF \u2248 **$172K in Austin purchasing power**. You'd be taking a real pay *cut* on day one.\n- **Salary negotiation success rate**: ~85% of candidates who counter-offer receive *some* improvement (Glassdoor/Payscale data). Using a competing offer specifically yields a median 10-15% bump.\n- **Remote work promotion penalty**: Research from NBER and Microsoft's own internal studies show remote workers are **38% less likely to receive promotions** than in-office peers, though this gap is narrowing.\n- **Relocation regret**: Surveys (United Van Lines, Hire a Helper) show ~30% of cross-state movers report regret within 2 years, with top reasons being cost of living shock and loss of social network.\n- **SF tech career premium**: Engineers who spend 3+ years in SF/Bay Area command **15-25% higher lifetime earnings** even after leaving, due to network and resume effects (levels.fyi longitudinal data).\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring on gross salary** | $250K vs $180K *feels* like a 39% raise. After tax and COL, it's roughly flat or negative. The $70K gap is an illusion in real purchasing power. |\n| **Binary framing** | You presented this as take-it-or-leave-it. You have at least 4 other options. The best moves may be ones you didn't mention. |\n| **Omission of negotiation** | Not countering is leaving money on the table in *both* directions (negotiate SF higher OR leverage it in Austin). |\n| **Status quo bias** | Staying feels \"safe\" but ignores opportunity cost of career acceleration. |\n| **Focusing illusion** | Salary is salient; you didn't mention what the SF *role* is, who you'd work with, what you'd build, or equity/RSU packages\u2014which often matter more at senior level. |\n| **Neglect of partner impact** | \"Flexible\" \u2260 \"indifferent.\" Partner social ties, preferences, and career trajectory are underweighted in your framing. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value)\n\n### Composite Expected Value Scoring\n\nWeighting: Savings (30%), Career Capital (40%), Life Satisfaction (30%)\n\n*Normalizing to a 0-100 scale:*\n\n| Option | Savings Score | Career Score | Satisfaction Score | **Weighted Total** |\n|--------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|\n| SF (city) | 35 | 85 | 60 | **63** |\n| SF (suburb) | 50 | 80 | 55 | **63** |\n| Stay Austin | 55 | 50 | 70 | **57** |\n| **Negotiate Austin raise** | 70 | 55 | 75 | **65** |\n| **Remote from Austin** | 65 | 70 | 75 | **70** \u2605 |\n| Broad search | 55 | 65 | 55 | **59** |\n\n---\n\n### Primary Recommendation: **Counter-offer for remote/hybrid from Austin (Option 5)**\n\n> Use the $250K SF offer as leverage to negotiate a remote arrangement at $210-230K with the SF company. You preserve Austin's zero state income tax, low housing costs, established life, and partner stability\u2014while getting on the SF company's compensation ladder and career trajectory.\n\n### If they refuse remote:\n\n> **Fallback A**: Use the SF offer to negotiate $200K+ at your current Austin employer. This is the highest-satisfaction, highest-savings option.\n\n> **Fallback B**: Accept the SF offer and move\u2014**but only if** (a) the *role itself* represents a meaningful career level-up (Staff eng? High-impact team? Strong equity?), and (b) you and your partner genuinely want the SF lifestyle. The financial case alone does not justify the move.\n\n### Key Action Items Before Deciding\n1. **Ask the SF company about remote/hybrid.** Many companies are flexible for senior hires. You lose nothing by asking.\n2. **Get the full comp breakdown**: RSUs, bonus, signing bonus, refreshers. At senior level, equity can be $50-150K+/year and changes the math entirely.\n3. **Have a real conversation with your partner.** \"Flexible\" needs to become a concrete preference.\n4. **Model your actual budget in SF** using a tool like Nerdwallet or SmartAsset's COL calculator with your real spending categories.\n\n**The $70K headline number is a mirage. The real decision is about career trajectory and life design\u2014and you likely have more options than you think.**",
