Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n| KPI | Definition | Measurement | Current Baseline (est.) |\n|-----|-----------|-------------|------------------------|\n| **Engineering Throughput** | Story points / features shipped per sprint per engineer | Velocity tracking | Assume ~60% of target |\n| **Time-to-Productive-Hire** | Months from decision to the point where the solution actually increases net throughput | Calendar time | N/A (status quo = 0 but declining) |\n| **Cash Efficiency** | Burn rate impact per unit of throughput gained ($ per incremental story point) | Monthly cost \u00f7 \u0394 velocity | Current burn is baseline |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Options Identified\n\n| # | Option | Description |\n|---|--------|-------------|\n| **A** | **Hire a VP of Engineering** | Senior external hire ($250-350k+ equity) to manage team, process, hiring |\n| **B** | **Promote/hire an Engineering Manager** | Mid-level manager (~$180-250k) to handle people/process; CTO retains strategic authority |\n| **C** | **Fractional / Part-time VPE** | Contract VPE 2-3 days/week ($15-25k/mo) as a bridge |\n| **D** | **Invest in process, not people** | Hire an experienced senior/staff engineer + implement better eng ops (CI/CD, on-call rotation, sprint discipline) |\n| **E** | **Do nothing (status quo)** | CTO continues absorbing both roles |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Estimates: Point Values and 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: Engineering Throughput Gain (% improvement over 6 months)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A \u2013 VP Eng | +40% | [+10%, +70%] | High ceiling but wide variance; depends heavily on hire quality and cultural fit |\n| B \u2013 Eng Manager | +30% | [+15%, +50%] | Narrower scope = more predictable gains; less strategic leverage |\n| C \u2013 Fractional VPE | +20% | [+5%, +35%] | Part-time presence limits depth; good for process but weaker on team building |\n| D \u2013 Process + Sr Eng | +25% | [+10%, +40%] | Removes specific bottlenecks; no management layer added |\n| E \u2013 Do nothing | -10% | [-25%, +5%] | CTO burnout accelerates; attrition risk grows |\n\n### KPI 2: Time-to-Productive (months until net-positive throughput impact)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A \u2013 VP Eng | 5 months | [3, 9] | Search takes 2-4 months, ramp 2-4 months; initial disruption likely |\n| B \u2013 Eng Manager | 3.5 months | [2, 6] | Faster search, lower bar for cultural authority; less ramp friction |\n| C \u2013 Fractional VPE | 1.5 months | [1, 3] | Can start in weeks; immediate process impact |\n| D \u2013 Process + Sr Eng | 3 months | [2, 5] | Tooling/process changes have lead time; sr eng hire still takes time |\n| E \u2013 Do nothing | 0 months | [0, 0] | Immediate but trajectory is negative |\n\n### KPI 3: Incremental Annual Burn ($k/year)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A \u2013 VP Eng | $350k | [$280k, $450k] | Salary + equity + recruiter fees (often 20-25% of Y1 comp) |\n| B \u2013 Eng Manager | $220k | [$180k, $280k] | Lower comp band; possibly no recruiter |\n| C \u2013 Fractional VPE | $200k | [$150k, $280k] | $15-25k/mo contract; no equity dilution typically |\n| D \u2013 Process + Sr Eng | $250k | [$200k, $320k] | Sr eng comp + tooling costs |\n| E \u2013 Do nothing | $0 | [$0, $0] | Zero direct cost; high hidden cost (attrition, missed milestones) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **VP Eng search at Series A typically takes 3-5 months.** First Rounds's talent data suggests median time-to-fill for VP-level eng roles is ~4 months. At 15 people, you're competing for candidates who often prefer larger teams where the role is more clearly defined.\n\n- **~40% of first VPE hires at startups don't last 18 months** (various VC post-mortems from a16z, First Round Review, Pilot studies). The most common failure modes are CTO/VPE role-boundary conflict and culture mismatch.\n\n- **CTO burnout is a top-3 Series A risk.** Carta data on startup post-mortems identifies \"founder/CTO overload\" as a contributing factor in ~30% of post-Series A stalls.\n\n- **Eng manager \u2192 VPE promotion path is common.** Many successful scaling stories (Stripe, early Shopify) hired a strong EM first and promoted or hired a VPE later once the team exceeded ~25-30 people.\n\n- **Fractional executives have grown ~300% since 2020** in startup usage (Toptal/a]Team data), but long-term retention and loyalty remain reported concerns.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cognitive Biases Detected in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Seniority Bias / Title Inflation** | Jumping to \"VP\" when the actual problem may be solved by a lower-level role. The framing assumes the problem requires a VP-level solution. |\n| **Single-Cause Fallacy** | \"Engineering is our bottleneck\" \u2014 is it headcount? Process? Unclear priorities? Tech debt? The diagnosis is bundled into the solution. |\n| **Anchoring on the CTO** | Framing centers the CTO's relief as the goal, rather than team throughput. What if the CTO's architecture instincts are actually the bottleneck (over-engineering, rewrites)? |\n| **Omission of the \"do less\" option** | No consideration of reducing scope / saying no to features. Throughput problems are often demand-side, not supply-side. |\n| **Survivorship Bias** | You likely heard VPE success stories from other founders; the 40% failure rate is invisible. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Expected Value Analysis & Recommendation\n\n### Composite Score (simplified, normalized)\n\nWeighting: Throughput (50%), Speed (30%), Cost-efficiency (20%)\n\n| Option | Throughput (weighted) | Speed (weighted) | Cost (weighted, inverted) | **Composite** |\n|--------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------|---------------|\n| A \u2013 VP Eng | 20.0 | 4.5 | 5.7 | **30.2** |\n| B \u2013 Eng Manager | 15.0 | 7.7 | 9.1 | **31.8** \u2705 |\n| C \u2013 Fractional VPE | 10.0 | 10.0 | 10.0 | **30.0** |\n| D \u2013 Process + Sr Eng | 12.5 | 7.5 | 8.0 | **28.0** |\n| E \u2013 Do nothing | -5.0 | 10.0 | 20.0 | **25.0** |\n\n*(Scores normalized within each column: higher = better; cost inverted so lower cost = higher score)*\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation: **Option B + C (Sequenced)**\n\n### Phase 1 (Now \u2192 Month 2): Hire a Fractional VPE\n- **Immediate triage**: audit eng process, identify the *actual* bottleneck (is it really management? or is it tech debt, unclear specs, or overcommitment?), install basic operating cadence (sprint planning, retros, capacity planning).\n- **De-risk the permanent hire** by learning what the role actually needs at your company.\n- **Buy the CTO 10 hours/week back** starting within weeks.\n\n### Phase 2 (Month 2 \u2192 Month 5): Hire a Full-Time Engineering Manager\n- You now have a fractional VPE who can **help you write the job spec, source candidates, and evaluate fit** \u2014 dramatically reducing mis-hire risk.\n- Target an EM who can grow into VPE if the company scales to 30+ engineers.\n- Comp band is Series A-appropriate; doesn't create awkward comp dynamics with your existing team.\n\n### Phase 3 (Month 6+): Reassess\n- If you're approaching 25-30 engineers post-hiring ramp, *then* evaluate a full VPE.\n- By this point, you'll have real data on what the role needs \u2014 not a guess.\n\n### Why NOT a VP of Engineering right now?\n> At 15 people (likely 8-10 engineers), a VP of Engineering is **over-titled for the job and under-scoped for the person**. You'll attract candidates who want to build a 50-person org, and give them a 10-person team with unclear authority boundaries against a founder-CTO. That's the #1 setup for the 40% failure rate.\n\n### Critical caveat\nBefore hiring *anyone*, spend one week with the CTO to answer: **\"If we could only ship one thing in the next 8 weeks, what would it be, and what's stopping us?\"** If the answer is \"we're trying to ship six things,\" the bottleneck is prioritization, not management \u2014 and no hire fixes that.",
