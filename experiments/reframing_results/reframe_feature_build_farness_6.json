This is *not* consumer \u2014 don't expect 80% adoption.\n- **\"Users asking for it\" is noisy signal.** Product management research (Pendo, ProductPlan surveys) shows that features explicitly requested by customers are adopted at expected rates only **~30-40% of the time**. The vocal minority problem is real.\n- **PWAs have closed the gap significantly.** Google case studies show PWAs achieve **~60-80% of native app engagement** in many use cases, at **20-30% of the cost**.\n- **B2B SaaS companies with <500 customers** that build native apps typically see **<20% install rates** (based on aggregate data from SaaS benchmarking communities).\n- **$200K for a 200-customer company** means you need **$1,000 incremental revenue per customer** just to break even \u2014 that's meaningful for a B2B book of business.\n- **Maintenance costs for native apps** run **15-25% of build cost annually** ($30-50K/year ongoing), often underestimated.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Availability bias** | \"Users have been asking\" \u2014 the loudest voices dominate perception. How many of 200 customers actually asked? 10? 50? This matters enormously. |\n| **Anchoring on the presented option** | The question frames this as binary (build native app or don't). It omits PWA, responsive redesign, and hybrid \u2014 potentially superior options. |\n| **Feature parity bias** | Assumption that \"mobile = native app.\" In 2024, this is increasingly untrue for B2B workflows. |\n| **Sunk cost of the question** | The team has already invested emotional energy in exploring this. The $200K estimate suggests some scoping has been done, creating momentum bias toward \"yes.\" |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | $200K and 4 months of engineering time could build 2-3 other features. What's the next-best use of those resources? This is completely absent from the framing. |\n| **Pro-innovation bias** | Building something new feels productive. Optimizing what exists feels boring. But the latter often has higher ROI. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### **Do NOT build the native app. Build a PWA instead.**\n\n**The expected value calculation strongly favors Option B (PWA):**\n\n| | Native App (A) | PWA (B) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Cost** | $200K + ~$40K/yr maintenance | $50K + ~$10K/yr maintenance |\n| **Expected 18-mo ROI** | +15% (wide variance) | +80% (favorable variance) |\n| **NRR impact** | +3% (marginal edge over PWA) | +2% (nearly as good) |\n| **Risk-adjusted EV** | Moderate | **Highest** |\n| **Opportunity cost** | 4 months of eng team | 6-8 weeks of eng team |\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **The NRR upside of native vs. PWA is ~1 percentage point** \u2014 not enough to justify 4x the cost and 2-3x the timeline.\n2. **Base rates tell us B2B mobile adoption will be modest** regardless of form factor. You're likely looking at 30-50 active mobile users, not 150. A PWA serves this adequately.\n3. **The real risk is opportunity cost.** Four months and $200K for your engineering team at 200 customers means you're in a growth-critical phase. Those resources likely generate more value on core product, onboarding optimization, or integrations.\n4. **PWA gives you a learning asset.** Ship it in 6-8 weeks, measure actual mobile usage for 3-4 months, and then make a data-informed decision about native. If mobile engagement exceeds 25%, the native app case strengthens considerably.\n\n### Suggested Action Plan\n\n> **Month 1-2:** Build and ship PWA with push notifications and key mobile workflows\n> **Month 3-5:** Measure actual adoption (install rate, weekly engagement, session depth)\n> **Month 6:** Decision gate \u2014 if mobile WAU >25% of user base, greenlight native/hybrid app with validated requirements\n\nThis approach preserves optionality, reduces downside risk by ~75%, and converts the decision from a **$200K bet on assumptions** into a **$50K experiment that generates data**.",
