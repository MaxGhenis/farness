  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your Startup Decision\n\nThis is a high-stakes decision, so I want to be genuinely helpful rather than just cheerleading or just being cautious. Let me work through this honestly.\n\n## What's actually at stake\n\n**You're not choosing between \"safe\" and \"risky.\"** You're choosing between two different risks:\n- **Staying:** Risk of regret, stagnation, and wondering \"what if\" \u2014 while the window for this idea may close\n- **Leaving:** Risk of financial stress, career disruption, and the ~90% base rate of startup failure\n\n## Factors that work in your favor\n\n- **Dual income household** \u2014 this is significant; you're not betting your family's entire livelihood\n- **$200K runway** \u2014 depending on your burn rate, that's potentially 12-18 months\n- **PM at Google** \u2014 strong signal for fundraising, hiring, and your fallback options are excellent\n- **Developer tools** \u2014 a domain where one person with deep conviction can build something real before needing a team\n- **You said \"passionate\"** \u2014 this matters more than people admit; startups are brutal and motivation is a real resource\n\n## Factors that work against you\n\n- **2-year-old** \u2014 this isn't just financial; it's about time, stress on your marriage, and your presence during a critical window of your kid's life. Be honest with yourself about this.\n- **$350K is a lot to walk away from** \u2014 that's not just salary, it's equity vesting, benefits, 401K matching. Your true opportunity cost is probably $450K+/year.\n- **\"I have an idea\" vs. \"I have traction\"** \u2014 these are very different starting points\n- **$200K sounds like a lot but isn't** \u2014 as a family with a toddler in a high cost-of-living area, that savings cushion can evaporate fast, especially if it's also your emergency fund\n\n## The honest questions you need to answer\n\n1. **Have you actually validated this?** Have you talked to 30+ developers who'd pay for this? Or is this still mostly in your head?\n2. **Does this require full-time right now?** Can you build an MVP in evenings/weekends and get to some proof point first?\n3. **Have you talked to your spouse \u2014 really talked?** Not \"would you support me\" but \"here's what the next 2 years might actually look like financially and emotionally, are we genuinely aligned?\"\n4. **What's your kill criteria?** If you don't know in advance what would make you stop, you'll burn through everything.\n\n## My actual recommendation\n\n**Don't quit yet. But set up a serious 90-day test first.**\n\nHere's why: the biggest risk isn't that you leave Google \u2014 it's that you leave Google *before you have any signal that this works*, burn through savings and goodwill, and end up back in a PM role anyway but with more stress and less savings.\n\n### Concretely:\n\n1. **Spend the next 8-12 weeks doing intensive customer discovery** \u2014 evenings, weekends, take some PTO. Talk to 30-50 potential users. Try to get 5 people to say \"I would pay for this.\"\n2. **Build the smallest possible prototype.** In developer tools, you can often get something real out the door part-time.\n3. **If you get real signal** \u2014 people using it, willingness to pay, organic interest \u2014 then quit with conviction. You'll also be in a much stronger position to raise money if you want to.\n4. **If you quit, set clear terms:** runway limit (e.g., \"if I don't hit [milestone] in 12 months, I go back to work\"), monthly financial check-ins with your spouse, and a not-negotiable emergency fund you don't touch.\n\n## The meta-point\n\nThe people who tell you \"just leap, believe in yourself\" aren't the ones who'll cover your mortgage. And the people who tell you \"don't ever leave a $350K job\" are optimizing for regret minimization, not impact.\n\n**The best founders I've seen don't take blind leaps \u2014 they systematically de-risk until the leap is short enough to be smart.** You're in a great position to do exactly that.\n\nThe idea isn't going anywhere in 90 days. But what you learn in those 90 days might completely change how (or whether) you pursue it.",
