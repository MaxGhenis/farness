  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Probably yes, but slow down before you pull the trigger.\n\nThis is one of the most common \u2014 and most commonly *botched* \u2014 moves at your stage. Let me walk you through how I'd actually think about it.\n\n---\n\n## First, diagnose before you prescribe\n\n\"Engineering is our bottleneck\" and \"CTO is overwhelmed\" are symptoms. Before you hire a VP Eng, make sure you understand the actual cause. Ask honestly:\n\n**Is the problem really management capacity?**\n- Or is it unclear priorities, so the team builds the wrong things?\n- Or is it technical debt making everything take 3x longer?\n- Or is it that you actually need more engineers, not another leader?\n- Or is the CTO struggling with decisions, not just time?\n\nIf you haven't done this diagnostic, a VP Eng hire could be an expensive misfire. **A $300K+ hire that solves the wrong problem is worse than no hire.**\n\n---\n\n## If the diagnosis confirms you need a VP Eng, then yes \u2014 but understand what you're really doing\n\nYou're splitting one role into two. This means you need:\n\n### Clarity on the split\n| VP Engineering | CTO |\n|---|---|\n| Delivery, process, velocity | Technical vision, architecture |\n| People management, hiring | Hard technical decisions |\n| Sprint execution, accountability | R&D, build vs. buy, tech strategy |\n| \"How we build\" | \"What we build and why\" |\n\n**The honest risk:** Most CTO/VP Eng pairs at startups fail because the split is never actually clean. They step on each other. You need to define boundaries *before* you hire, not after.\n\n### Your CTO has to genuinely want this\nSome CTOs say they want to hand off management but actually resent it once someone else has authority over \"their\" team. Have a direct, uncomfortable conversation about this. If your CTO is ambivalent, this hire will blow up within 6 months.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually do in your shoes \u2014 a phased approach\n\n**Weeks 1\u20132: Diagnose the real bottleneck.**\nTalk to every engineer individually. Where do things get stuck? Is it decisions, process, headcount, clarity, tech debt? Map it.\n\n**Weeks 3\u20134: Try lightweight fixes first.**\n- Can a senior engineer step into a team lead role?\n- Can you hire an engineering manager (cheaper, lower risk) instead of a VP?\n- Can you offload non-architecture work from the CTO with a project manager or chief of staff?\n\n**If those don't work \u2192 hire the VP Eng.** But now you'll hire with a much sharper job description because you know exactly what problem they need to solve.\n\n---\n\n## Honest caveats you should hear\n\n- **At 15 people, a VP Eng can feel like premature bureaucracy.** Many great startups at your stage have a strong engineering manager instead. VP Eng typically makes more sense at 25-40+ engineers.\n- **The best VP Eng candidates will interview *you*.** They'll want to understand the CTO relationship, their authority, and whether you actually know what you want. If you're fuzzy on the role, strong candidates will walk.\n- **This hire takes 3-6 months to show results.** If you're hoping to unblock shipping in the next quarter, you need interim solutions regardless.\n\n---\n\n## The bottom line\n\n**Yes, the instinct is right \u2014 but the title might be wrong and the timing might be premature.** Start with the diagnosis, try a lighter-weight solution first, and if you still need a VP Eng, you'll make a much better hire because you waited 4-6 weeks to understand what you actually need.\n\nThe most expensive mistake at your stage isn't moving too slowly on a hire. It's making the wrong senior hire quickly and living with the fallout for a year.\n\n---\n\nWhat does the diagnostic look like in your case? I'm happy to push deeper on any of these threads if you tell me more about where things are actually getting stuck.",
