Mobile is rarely the primary interface.\n- **\"Users asking for it\" vs. actual usage**: The classic *say/do gap*. Product management research (Pragmatic Institute, Pendo) suggests **fewer than 30-40%** of users who request a feature become regular users of it.\n- **B2B SaaS mobile app ROI**: At 200 customers, this is a **$1,000/customer investment** for native. Industry benchmarks suggest mobile becomes ROI-positive more reliably at **500+ customers** or when mobile is core to the workflow (field service, sales, etc.).\n- **PWA satisfaction rates**: Google case studies show PWAs deliver **68-80% of native app satisfaction** at **15-30% of the cost** for most B2B use cases.\n- **Ongoing maintenance cost of native apps**: Typically **30-50% of initial build cost per year** (app store updates, OS changes, etc.), often underestimated.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Vocal minority bias** | \"Our users have been asking\" \u2014 How many? 10 out of 200? Or 150? Vocal requesters \u2260 representative demand. The framing implies broad demand without evidence. |\n| **Anchoring on the presented option** | The question is framed as binary (build native or don't), anchoring on the $200K native app and ignoring intermediate options like PWA. |\n| **Pro-innovation bias** | \"Mobile app\" sounds modern and progressive, creating an implicit assumption it's the right direction. |\n| **Neglect of ongoing costs** | The $200K figure frames this as a one-time investment; real cost is likely **$200K + $70K/year**, or ~$340K over 2 years. |\n| **IKEA effect / commitment escalation** | Once you start building, you'll feel compelled to finish and expand even if engagement data is weak. |\n| **Feature request \u2260 willingness to pay** | No mention of whether customers would pay more, renew more reliably, or if prospects are lost due to lack of mobile. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Primary Recommendation: **Option B \u2014 Build a PWA** (Expected Value dominant)\n\n**Expected Value Comparison (simplified, 18-month horizon):**\n\nAssuming average revenue per customer = $10K ARR (reasonable B2B SaaS with 200 customers):\n\n| Option | Incremental Revenue (est.) | Total Cost (18 mo) | Expected Profit | Risk-adjusted EV |\n|--------|---------------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-----------------:|\n| A: Native | $60K (3pp NRR \u00d7 $2M base) | $280K (build + maint) | \u2212$220K | **\u2212$180K** |\n| B: PWA | $40K | $60K | \u2212$20K | **+$10K** |\n| C: Responsive | $20K | $35K | \u2212$15K | **+$5K** |\n| E: Do nothing | $0 | $0 | $0 | **$0** |\n\n### The Logic\n\n1. **The PWA gets you 70-80% of the benefit at 20-30% of the cost.** This dramatically improves the risk/reward ratio.\n\n2. **You don't have enough customers to justify native app economics.** At 200 customers, the per-customer investment in native is too high unless mobile is *core* to your value proposition (and the framing suggests it isn't \u2014 it's a \"nice to have\").\n\n3. **Use the PWA as a demand test.** If mobile engagement exceeds 25% weekly active within 6 months, *that's* your evidence to invest in native. You'll have real data instead of feature requests.\n\n4. **Redirect the $140K savings** toward whatever actually drives NRR \u2014 onboarding, integrations, core feature gaps, or sales.\n\n### Decision Trigger for Native\nBuild native **if and when**:\n- PWA mobile weekly engagement > 25% sustained for 3+ months\n- Customer base exceeds 400, OR\n- You can identify \u22653 lost deals where native mobile was the deciding factor\n- A specific use case emerges that requires native device capabilities (camera, offline, GPS, push)\n\n> **Bottom line:** The answer to \"should we build a native app?\" is **not yet.** Ship a PWA in 6 weeks, measure real mobile demand, and let data \u2014 not feature requests \u2014 drive the $200K decision.",
