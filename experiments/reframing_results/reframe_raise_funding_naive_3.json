  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: Raise Now, But Strategically\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**Raise now.** But not for the reason most founders think, and with some important caveats.\n\n## The Core Reasoning\n\n### The math on waiting looks tempting but is misleading\n\nAt 15% MoM growth, in 6 months you'd be at ~$1.15M MRR. In theory, that gets you a higher valuation. Founders often fixate on this.\n\n**But here's what that analysis misses:**\n\n- **15% MoM growth is exceptional and unlikely to hold indefinitely.** Almost every company hits a growth deceleration. If you hit it *before* raising, your narrative weakens dramatically \u2014 even at higher revenue.\n- **12 months of runway means you actually have ~6-7 months before you *must* start raising.** Fundraising takes 3-5 months. You'd be negotiating from a position of decreasing leverage as runway shrinks.\n- **VC interest is a market condition, not a permanent state.** Funding environments shift. Interest rates, LP sentiment, sector rotation \u2014 none of this is in your control.\n\n### The real risk/reward calculation\n\n**If you wait and things go right:** You raise at maybe $300-400M instead of $200M. You give up a few fewer percentage points of dilution.\n\n**If you wait and things go wrong:** Growth dips to 8%, a competitor raises a mega-round, market sentiment shifts, or you hit a churn spike. Now you're raising at $150M \u2014 or worse, a down round \u2014 with 5 months of runway and VCs can smell the desperation.\n\n**The upside of waiting is incremental. The downside is existential.**\n\n## What I'd Actually Do\n\n**1. Raise now, but run a tight process**\n- Create competitive tension among interested VCs\n- Optimize for the *right partner and terms*, not just the highest valuation\n- A $200M valuation at $500K MRR (~33x multiple) is strong \u2014 don't get greedy\n\n**2. Negotiate what actually matters more than valuation**\n- Liquidation preferences (1x non-participating is your target)\n- Board composition\n- Pro-rata rights and anti-dilution provisions\n- These terms will matter more than the difference between $200M and $250M\n\n**3. Raise slightly more than you think you need**\n- If you can get $25M instead of $20M without meaningfully worse terms, take it\n- Extra runway compounds your strategic options\n\n## The One Scenario Where I'd Wait\n\nIf you have **genuine confidence** you can get to profitability or cash-flow breakeven on your current runway \u2014 meaning you wouldn't *need* to raise at all \u2014 then you have real leverage to wait. That changes the entire calculus because the downside scenario disappears.\n\nBut if you will definitely need this raise to survive, take the money when it's offered.\n\n## The Blunt Truth\n\nThe difference between a $200M and a $300M valuation matters to your ego and your spreadsheet. The difference between being funded and being in a desperate fundraise matters to your company's survival.\n\n**The best time to raise is when you don't have to.**\n\nThat's right now.",
