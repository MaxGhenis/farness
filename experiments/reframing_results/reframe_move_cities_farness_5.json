Move to SF** | $45K | $25K\u2013$65K | SF rent premium ~$25-35K/yr, taxes ~$8-12K more (CA vs TX), food/transport +$5-10K |\n| **2. Stay Austin $180K** | $50K | $35K\u2013$65K | No state income tax, median rent ~$1,800 for nice 2BR |\n| **3. Remote SF role (~$220K)** | $65K | $45K\u2013$80K | SF-caliber pay, Austin costs, typical 10-15% remote discount |\n| **4. Counter in Austin** | $45K | $30K\u2013$60K | Realistic bump to $195-210K with competing offer leverage |\n| **5. SF for 1-2yr, then leave** | $30K (yr1-2), $60K (yr3+) | Wide range | Short-term savings hit, long-term comp reset higher |\n\n**Key insight: SF $250K and Austin $180K produce roughly similar savings.** The $70K headline gap is largely consumed by COL.\n\n### KPI 2: Career Capital (Expected Comp in Year 5)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| **1. Move to SF** | $340K | $290K\u2013$420K | SF network effects, FAANG/startup adjacency, stronger signal on resume |\n| **2. Stay Austin $180K** | $230K | $200K\u2013$280K | Austin tech scene growing but comp ceiling is lower |\n| **3. Remote SF role** | $300K | $250K\u2013$370K | SF employer trajectory, but remote workers face promotion penalty |\n| **4. Counter in Austin** | $240K | $210K\u2013$290K | Modest improvement, same ceiling problem |\n| **5. SF 1-2yr stint** | $310K | $260K\u2013$380K | Resume boost captured, flexibility to relocate to cheaper market |\n\n### KPI 3: Life Satisfaction (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| **1. Move to SF** | 6.5 | 5.0\u20138.0 | Exciting but housing downgrade likely, rebuilding social network, partner isolation risk |\n| **2. Stay Austin** | 7.0 | 6.0\u20138.0 | Established life, but potential \"what if\" regret, career stagnation risk |\n| **3. Remote SF role** | 8.0 | 6.5\u20139.0 | Best of both worlds if achievable; risk of being \"out of sight, out of mind\" |\n| **4. Counter in Austin** | 7.5 | 6.5\u20138.5 | Validated market worth, no disruption |\n| **5. SF 1-2yr stint** | 6.0 | 4.5\u20137.5 | Transient lifestyle is stressful, but framed as adventure it can work |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **SF vs. Austin COL ratio**: ~1.45-1.75x depending on lifestyle (BLS, Numbeo 2024). Your $250K/$180K = 1.39x, meaning **you're not fully compensated for the COL difference**.\n- **Remote negotiation success rate**: ~40-60% of offers have remote flexibility when asked directly, especially post-2020 (Levels.fyi surveys).\n- **Promotion penalty for remote workers**: 15-30% less likely to be promoted in a given cycle (Stanford/NBER, Bloom 2023).\n- **Relocation regret rate**: ~30% of tech workers who relocate for a role report regret within 18 months (Blind surveys, 2022-2023).\n- **Counter-offer success rate**: Presenting a competing offer yields a raise ~60-70% of the time, though the median bump is 8-15%, not full matching (Glassdoor data).\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring** | You're anchored on the $70K gap ($250K vs $180K). This is a *gross* number. Net-of-COL gap is closer to **$0\u2013$10K**. |\n| **Binary framing** | You presented \"take it or don't.\" The best options (3 and 4) weren't in your original frame. |\n| **Prestige bias** | SF carries a narrative of \"making it\" in tech. This is real career capital but also partly status-seeking. |\n| **Loss aversion** | Declining feels like \"leaving $70K on the table\" \u2014 but you're not losing money you never had. |\n| **Neglect of partner impact** | \"They're flexible\" may underweight the real social/emotional cost of uprooting a partner who has no professional reason to move. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value)\n\n### Optimal strategy (in order):\n\n> **\u2460 First: Negotiate Option 3 (remote/hybrid at ~$220-235K).** This dominates on all three KPIs. Even at a 10-15% discount, Austin-based savings exceed the SF scenario, career capital is strong (SF employer brand), and life disruption is minimal. Probability of success: ~40-50%, but the ask costs nothing.\n\n> **\u2461 If remote is rejected: Execute Option 4 (counter in Austin).** Use the written SF offer to negotiate $195-215K with your current employer. You capture $15-35K in new value with zero moving costs and zero life disruption.\n\n> **\u2462 If both fail and you truly value career acceleration: Option 5 (move for 1-2 years, then reassess).** Frame it as a deliberate career investment with an exit plan. This avoids the trap of indefinite SF living costs while capturing the network and resume benefits.\n\n> **\u2463 Taking the SF offer as a permanent move (Option 1) is the weakest \"obvious\" choice.** It ranks last or near-last on savings and life satisfaction, with only a modest edge on career capital over Options 3 and 5.\n\n### Bottom line\n**The SF salary is a negotiating asset, not necessarily a destination.** The highest expected value comes from leveraging it without absorbing San Francisco's cost structure. Move only if career acceleration is your dominant priority *and* remote is truly off the table.",
