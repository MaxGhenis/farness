  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: Raise Now, But Strategically\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**Raise now.** But not for the reason most founders think, and with some important caveats.\n\n## Let me walk through the real reasoning:\n\n### The math looks seductive to wait\n\nAt 15% MoM growth, in 6 months you'd be at ~$1.15M MRR. That *could* command a significantly higher valuation. I understand the temptation.\n\n### But here's why that thinking is dangerous:\n\n**1. You're conflating the expected case with the guaranteed case.**\n- 15% MoM growth for 6 more months is not a law of physics. It's a trend. Growth rates compress. Markets shift. A competitor can launch. A key hire can leave. You know this.\n\n**2. 12 months of runway is not \"comfortable\" \u2014 it's a countdown.**\n- Best-case fundraising takes 3-4 months. That means you realistically need to *start* raising in 6-8 months anyway or face raising from a position of desperation. You're not choosing between \"now\" and \"later.\" You're choosing between \"from strength\" and \"from pressure.\"\n\n**3. The VC interest window is open RIGHT NOW.**\n- Investor enthusiasm is a mood, not a contract. The fact that VCs are inbound today doesn't mean they will be in 6 months. Macro conditions change. Fund cycles matter. A hot competitive round elsewhere can shift attention.\n\n**4. Dilution math isn't what most founders think it is.**\n- Selling 10% at $200M now vs. hypothetically 8% at $350M later \u2014 the difference in your ownership is marginal. What's NOT marginal is the risk of the \"later\" scenario not materializing.\n\n## What actually matters more than valuation:\n\n- **Who** is offering the $20M? A top-tier firm with real operational value is worth more than a higher number from a passive investor.\n- **What terms** beyond valuation \u2014 liquidation preferences, board seats, pro-rata rights, protective provisions. A \"better valuation\" with worse terms can destroy more value than dilution.\n- **What you'll do with the money.** If you have clear, high-conviction ways to deploy $20M that accelerate your trajectory (not just extend runway), that strengthens the case significantly.\n\n## The honest risk nobody wants to say out loud:\n\nThe graveyard of startups is full of companies that were growing 15% MoM, *chose not to raise when they could*, and then hit a wall \u2014 growth slowed to 8%, the market turned, and suddenly they were raising a down round or dying. You almost never hear these stories because dead companies don't write blog posts.\n\nYou rarely hear a founder say *\"I wish I had raised less money when investors wanted to give it to me.\"*\n\n## My specific recommendation:\n\n1. **Start the process now** while you have leverage and momentum\n2. **Run a tight process** \u2014 3-4 weeks, create competitive tension between interested VCs\n3. **Optimize for the right partner and clean terms** more than squeezing the last $25M of valuation\n4. **Raise enough to get 18-24 months of runway** at your planned burn rate post-investment\n5. **If the terms genuinely aren't good enough**, you have enough runway to walk away \u2014 but don't confuse \"not good enough\" with \"could theoretically be better later\"\n\n## The bottom line:\n\nA $200M valuation at $500K MRR ($6M ARR) is roughly 33x ARR. That is a **strong** valuation. Waiting to optimize from \"strong\" to \"slightly stronger\" while carrying real existential risk is not a bold move \u2014 it's a gamble dressed up as strategy.\n\nTake the money. Build the company. The next round is where the valuation really gets interesting anyway.\n\n---\n\n*What's your hesitation specifically? Is it truly about valuation, or is there something else making you pause? Sometimes the real question is hiding behind the obvious one.*",
