Housing alone is 80-120% more. |\n| **CA vs. TX effective tax gap** | ~$12K\u2013$18K/year at this income level (CA marginal ~9.3% vs. TX 0%) |\n| **% of engineers who regret SF relocation for money** | Anecdotally high (~40%) within 2 years, primarily due to housing shock (Blind surveys, levels.fyi forums) |\n| **Success rate of negotiating remote work with an offer in hand** | ~30-50% for senior roles post-2023; higher if the company already has remote infrastructure |\n| **Raise from counter-offer retention** | Average 10-20%; but 50% of counter-offer acceptors leave within 18 months anyway (Harvard Business Review) |\n| **SF network effect on career trajectory** | Engineers in SF metro earn ~15-25% more at the 10-year mark even controlling for skill (Hired.com annual reports) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring on nominal salary** | \"$250K vs. $180K\" frames a $70K gap that *feels* enormous but nets closer to break-even or even negative after COL adjustment |\n| **Binary framing** | You presented this as \"take it or don't\" \u2014 ignoring Options C, D, and E which may dominate both |\n| **Status quo bias** | The comfort of Austin may cause you to under-weight the real long-term career acceleration of SF-tier companies |\n| **Neglect of optionality value** | An SF offer in hand is an *asset* \u2014 even if you don't move. Its leverage value is being under-utilized if you only consider accept/reject |\n| **Availability bias** | \"Cost of living is way higher\" is vivid and salient; long-term earnings trajectory and network effects are abstract and under-weighted |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value Ranking)\n\n### Composite Ranking (weighted: 30% discretionary income, 40% 5-yr earnings, 30% QoL)\n\n| Rank | Option | Weighted Score | Notes |\n|------|--------|---------------|-------|\n| **1** | **C: Negotiate remote/hybrid at SF-adjusted pay** | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 | Attempt this FIRST. High upside, low downside. Even partial success ($210-220K remote) dominates. |\n| **2** | **E: Accept SF for 2-3 years as career investment** | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 | Best long-term EV if Option C fails. Treat it as a \"tour of duty\" with a planned exit. |\n| **3** | **D: Use offer to renegotiate in Austin** | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 | Good fallback. Be transparent with current employer. Aim for $210K+. |\n| **4** | **A: Move to SF permanently** | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 | Only if you *want* the SF lifestyle. Financially it's roughly neutral. Career-positive, QoL-uncertain. |\n| **5** | **B: Decline, change nothing** | \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 | Worst expected value. Leaves money and optionality on the table. |\n\n---\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n> **Don't frame this as \"move or stay.\" Frame it as \"how do I extract maximum value from this offer?\"**\n>\n> **First action:** Go back to the SF company and ask about remote or hybrid arrangements from Austin. You have a 30-50% chance of success, and the expected value of even asking is ~$20-30K/year with zero downside.\n>\n> **If that fails:** Seriously consider Option E \u2014 accept SF as a 2-3 year career accelerant, not a permanent move. The network, brand, and comp trajectory advantages compound.\n>\n> **Do not** simply decline and stay pat. That is the only option with clearly negative expected value relative to your alternatives.",
