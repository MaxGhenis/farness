  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Probably yes, but slow down before you pull the trigger.\n\nThis is one of the most common \u2014 and most commonly *botched* \u2014 moves at your stage. Let me walk you through how I'd actually think about it.\n\n---\n\n## First, diagnose the real problem\n\n\"Engineering is our bottleneck\" and \"CTO is overwhelmed\" can point to very different root causes. Before hiring, be honest about which of these is actually happening:\n\n**Sometimes the problem is management load**\n- The CTO is spending all day in 1:1s, sprint planning, hiring coordination, and has no time for technical work\n- The team is actually pretty good but lacks process, prioritization, or air cover\n- *A VP Eng probably helps here*\n\n**Sometimes the problem is something else entirely**\n- The technical architecture is the bottleneck (a VP Eng won't fix this)\n- You have the wrong engineers, not too few managers\n- Product keeps changing direction, so engineering \"can't ship\" because the target moves\n- The CTO is overwhelmed because they can't delegate or won't let go, and a VP Eng will just create a power struggle\n\n**Be really honest about which world you're in.** If you hire a VP Eng to solve a problem that's actually about architecture, product direction, or the CTO's own working style, you'll burn 6 months and a lot of money.\n\n---\n\n## If you do move forward, here's what I'd think about\n\n### The CTO has to genuinely want this\nThis fails most often when the CTO agrees intellectually but emotionally experiences it as losing their team. Have a direct conversation: *\"What would you do with your time if someone else handled the people and process side?\"* If they light up, good sign. If they get defensive, you have a harder conversation ahead.\n\n### The role split needs to be crisp\nThe classic model:\n- **VP Engineering** \u2192 people, process, delivery, hiring, team health\n- **CTO** \u2192 architecture, technical vision, R&D, key technical decisions\n\nBut at 15 people, these blur constantly. You need both people to be comfortable with ambiguity and genuinely collaborative. Two big egos in these roles at a small startup is a disaster.\n\n### Seniority matters a lot\nYou need someone who has managed engineering teams of 15-40 people before and is comfortable with the messy, under-resourced reality of a startup. A VP Eng from a 500-person company will likely over-process everything. Someone too junior won't actually free up the CTO.\n\n### Consider the timing and alternatives\n- **Could a strong Engineering Manager (one level down) solve 70% of this for now?** Easier to hire, cheaper, less organizational disruption.\n- **Could you promote someone internal?** Even temporarily \u2014 sometimes a senior engineer who's good with people can take on team lead responsibilities.\n- At 15 people you're arguably early for a true VP Eng. Many startups do this at 25-40. That said, if your CTO is genuinely drowning, waiting creates its own damage.\n\n---\n\n## The risk I'd flag\n\nThe biggest risk isn't hiring the wrong person (though that's real). It's **using a hire to avoid a harder conversation.** \n\nSome questions worth sitting with:\n\n- Is the CTO actually the right CTO for the next phase of the company?\n- Is the product roadmap realistic, or are you overpromising to the board?\n- Are you throwing headcount at what's actually a focus problem?\n\nThese are uncomfortable, but a Series A is the moment to confront them.\n\n---\n\n## My bottom line\n\n**If** the core problem is genuinely that management overhead is consuming someone who should be doing technical leadership, **and** your CTO actively wants a partner in this role, **and** you can find someone with the right experience and low ego \u2014 then yes, this is the right move and the right time.\n\nBut I'd spend two weeks pressure-testing the diagnosis before you open the req. Talk to the CTO, talk to the engineers individually, and look at *where time is actually going.* The answer might surprise you.\n\nWhat does the CTO say when you ask them what's actually eating their time?",
