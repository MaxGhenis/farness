  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Probably yes, but let me help you pressure-test this first.\n\nThe instinct to hire a VP of Engineering is reasonable here, but I've seen this move backfire when the underlying diagnosis is wrong. Let me walk through this honestly.\n\n---\n\n## First, make sure you're solving the right problem\n\n\"We can't ship fast enough\" has several possible root causes, and they lead to different solutions:\n\n**Is it actually a management bottleneck?**\n- The CTO is making too many decisions, reviewing all PRs, unblocking everyone, attending every meeting\n- Engineers are idle or context-switching because they're waiting on the CTO\n- *If yes \u2192 VP of Engineering is the right move*\n\n**Is it a talent/capacity bottleneck?**\n- You simply don't have enough engineers for the roadmap you've committed to\n- *If yes \u2192 you need to hire more engineers, and THEN you'll need the VP to manage them*\n\n**Is it a clarity/prioritization bottleneck?**\n- The team is building the wrong things, reworking constantly, or has unclear requirements\n- The CTO is overwhelmed because product direction is chaotic\n- *If yes \u2192 a VP of Eng won't fix this. You may have a product leadership problem.*\n\n**Is it a technical debt / architecture bottleneck?**\n- Shipping is slow because the codebase is fragile and everything takes 3x longer than it should\n- *If yes \u2192 you actually need the CTO focused on architecture AND the team needs to slow down to speed up. A VP of Eng can help create space for this, but set expectations that shipping won't accelerate immediately.*\n\n**Be honest with yourself about which of these is actually happening.** It might be more than one.\n\n---\n\n## If you do move forward, here's what I'd think about\n\n**The case for it is strong when:**\n- Your CTO is genuinely strong at architecture/technical vision but is drowning in people management, process, and cross-functional coordination\n- You have 15 people now and will likely be 25-40 within a year (post-Series A trajectory)\n- You're about to hire more engineers, which will make the management problem worse\n\n**Real risks to take seriously:**\n\n1. **CTO/VP of Eng tension is extremely common.** The role boundaries are blurry. If your CTO has been doing everything, handing over \"their team\" to someone else is emotionally hard even when they intellectually want it. You need explicit conversations about who owns what.\n\n2. **Hiring takes longer than you think.** A good VP of Eng hire takes 3-5 months. They take another 2-3 months to ramp. You won't feel relief for 6+ months. Do you have a plan for the interim?\n\n3. **At 15 people, this might be premature.** Some people would argue that an Engineering Manager or a strong team lead could bridge this gap at lower cost, lower risk, and faster hiring timeline. A VP of Eng at a 15-person company sometimes means you're paying for a senior title when you need a working manager.\n\n4. **You might be papering over a CTO gap.** I have to say this directly: sometimes \"the CTO is overwhelmed\" means the CTO isn't scaling with the company. A VP of Eng can compensate for this, but if the real issue is that your CTO needs to grow, adding a layer might just delay that reckoning. Only you know which situation you're in.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually do\n\n**Short term (now):** Have a very candid conversation with your CTO. Ask them what specifically is consuming their time and what they'd do differently with 20 more hours a week. Their answer will tell you a lot about whether a VP of Eng is the right solve.\n\n**Medium term (next 30 days):** Consider hiring a senior engineering manager first \u2014 someone who can own delivery, run standups, do 1:1s, handle hiring coordination. This is faster to hire, less politically complex, and tests whether management delegation actually unblocks things.\n\n**If that works and you're scaling past 20-25 engineers:** Promote or hire into a VP of Eng role with confidence that the model works.\n\n**If it doesn't work:** The problem probably isn't management bandwidth, and you've learned something important before making an expensive VP hire.\n\n---\n\n## The bottom line\n\nThe VP of Engineering hire is likely directionally correct given your stage, but **I'd stage the decision rather than jumping straight to the senior hire.** The fastest path to shipping faster is probably not the one that takes 6 months to show results.\n\nWhat does your CTO actually say when you ask them what's eating their time?",
