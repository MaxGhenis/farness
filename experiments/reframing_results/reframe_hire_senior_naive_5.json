  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Probably yes, but slow down before you pull the trigger.\n\nThis is one of the most common \u2014 and most commonly *botched* \u2014 moves at your stage. Let me walk through the real thinking.\n\n---\n\n## Why this instinct is likely correct\n\n- A CTO who's splitting time between architecture decisions, people management, sprint planning, hiring, and code review will be mediocre at all of them.\n- Post-Series A, the expectations on shipping velocity just jumped. You need someone whose *primary job* is engineering execution.\n- This is a well-established pattern: CTO \u2192 technical vision/architecture, VP Eng \u2192 delivery/people/process.\n\n**So directionally, yes. You likely need to separate these roles.**\n\n---\n\n## But here's where I'd push back and pressure-test\n\nBefore hiring, be honest about some harder questions:\n\n### 1. Is the bottleneck actually management, or something else?\n- **Unclear priorities?** A VP Eng won't fix that \u2014 that's a product/CEO problem.\n- **Technical debt?** More process won't help. You might need senior ICs instead.\n- **Wrong people on the team?** A new layer of management over underperformers just adds cost.\n- **The CTO is the bottleneck personally?** A VP Eng under a CTO who can't delegate or won't let go of control will quit within a year.\n\n*Really diagnose the bottleneck before assuming the org chart is the fix.*\n\n### 2. Will your CTO actually let go?\nThis is the question nobody asks honestly enough. Some CTOs say they want a VP Eng but then:\n- Override technical decisions\n- Stay in every standup\n- Won't cede hiring authority\n\nIf your CTO hasn't clearly articulated what they'd *stop doing*, this hire will fail. **Have that conversation first.**\n\n### 3. Can you hire well for this role right now?\nGood VP Engs for 15-person startups are rare. You need someone who:\n- Won't over-process a small team (the \"big company VP\" trap)\n- Is hands-on enough to earn credibility\n- Can work *under* a CTO without ego friction\n- Is okay with ambiguity and limited resources\n\nA bad VP Eng hire at your stage can be devastating \u2014 months of lost velocity, departures, cultural damage.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually do\n\n**Step 1 \u2014 This week:** Have a brutally honest conversation with your CTO. Ask: *\"If you could only do two things, what would they be? What are you doing today that drains you?\"* Map out exactly what would transfer.\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 Honestly evaluate whether an intermediate step works first:**\n- Could you promote or hire an Engineering Manager for 2-3 months to handle the day-to-day while you search?\n- Could a strong senior engineer absorb some of the tech lead responsibilities?\n- This buys you time to hire the VP Eng *well* rather than *fast*.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 If you move forward, define the role by the problems you're solving, not the title.** Write down the 3-4 specific outcomes you'd expect in the first 6 months. If you can't, you're not ready to hire.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Involve the CTO deeply in the hiring process.** This relationship is a marriage. If they don't have genuine chemistry and mutual respect, it will not work regardless of the candidate's resume.\n\n---\n\n## The honest bottom line\n\n**The split between CTO and VP Eng is probably the right move at your stage.** But the title isn't the solution \u2014 the *clarity* is. If you can get crystal clear on what's actually causing the bottleneck, what specifically would change with this hire, and whether your CTO is genuinely ready to share power, you'll make a good decision.\n\nIf you can't answer those questions yet, you're not ready to hire \u2014 you're ready to have some uncomfortable internal conversations first.\n\nWhat does the CTO themselves say about this when you ask them directly?",
