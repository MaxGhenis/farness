  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis: Farness Framework\n\n## 1. Define Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **NPV of Lifetime Earnings** | Present value of all future earnings minus costs, discounted at 5% | 20-year horizon |\n| **Career Optionality Score** | Number of distinct career paths accessible (roles \u00d7 industries) | 5 years post-decision |\n| **Risk-Adjusted Satisfaction** | Composite of comp, autonomy, intellectual engagement (1-10 scale) | 10-year average |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Options (Expanding Beyond Binary)\n\n| # | Option |\n|---|--------|\n| A | **Full-time MBA now** (2 years, $160K tuition) |\n| B | **Stay in SWE, no MBA** |\n| C | **Part-time / Executive MBA** while working |\n| D | **Defer 2-3 years**, build more experience, then MBA |\n| E | **Skip MBA, pivot via alternative paths** (bootcamp in PM/data science, internal transfer to product/strategy, or start a company) |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n**Total Cost of MBA (Option A):**\n- Tuition: $160K\n- Foregone salary (2 years): ~$270K (including raises)\n- **All-in cost: ~$430K**\n\n### KPI 1: 20-Year NPV of Incremental Earnings (vs. staying in SWE)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 Full-time MBA now | **+$250K** | (\u2212$200K to +$900K) |\n| B \u2014 Stay in SWE | **$0** (baseline) | \u2014 |\n| C \u2014 Part-time MBA | **+$150K** | (\u2212$50K to +$400K) |\n| D \u2014 Defer MBA 2-3 yrs | **+$350K** | (\u2212$100K to +$1M) |\n| E \u2014 Alt pivot (PM/startup) | **+$100K** | (\u2212$300K to +$1.5M) |\n\n### KPI 2: Career Optionality (Accessible Paths, 5-yr horizon)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 Full-time MBA | **8 paths** | (5\u201312) |\n| B \u2014 Stay in SWE | **3 paths** | (2\u20135) |\n| C \u2014 Part-time MBA | **5 paths** | (3\u20137) |\n| D \u2014 Defer MBA | **9 paths** | (6\u201312) |\n| E \u2014 Alt pivot | **5 paths** | (2\u20139) |\n\n### KPI 3: Risk-Adjusted Satisfaction (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 Full-time MBA | **7.0** | (5.0\u20138.5) |\n| B \u2014 Stay in SWE | **6.0** | (4.5\u20137.5) |\n| C \u2014 Part-time MBA | **6.5** | (5.0\u20137.5) |\n| D \u2014 Defer MBA | **7.5** | (5.5\u20139.0) |\n| E \u2014 Alt pivot | **6.5** | (3.5\u20139.0) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Data Point | Source / Finding |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Post-MBA salary (top-15 program)** | Median ~$175K base + $30K signing bonus (GMAC 2023). But SWE at 3 YOE trending toward $175K+ anyway at FAANG. |\n| **SWE salary at 10 YOE (no MBA)** | $200\u2013350K total comp at strong companies (levels.fyi) |\n| **MBA ROI for tech workers specifically** | Studies (Poets & Quants, Bloomberg) show **tech\u2192MBA\u2192tech is often NPV-negative**; MBA ROI is highest for career *switchers* from low-paying industries |\n| **% of MBA grads who say \"worth it\"** | ~75% say yes (GMAC Alumni Survey) \u2014 but survivorship bias is significant |\n| **MBA grads entering PE/consulting comp** | $190\u2013220K base Y1, but hours are 60-80/week; risk-adjusted hourly rate is similar to senior SWE |\n| **Regret rate for NOT getting MBA** | Hard to measure, but engineers who reach Staff+ level rarely cite MBA absence as a blocker |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Prestige bias** | \"Good MBA program\" triggers status-seeking; prestige \u2260 ROI for your specific situation |\n| **Action bias** | Acceptance letter creates urgency to \"do something\"; staying put feels passive but may be optimal |\n| **Anchoring on admission** | Being admitted feels like a sunk investment \u2014 it isn't. Admission is a free option, not an obligation |\n| **Grass-is-greener / narrative bias** | MBA marketing sells transformation stories; your counterfactual SWE career growth is underweighted |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | Framing as \"$160K decision\" when it's actually a **$430K+ decision** including foregone comp and compounding equity/RSU growth |\n| **Survivorship bias in MBA testimonials** | You hear from the Goldman/McKinsey MBA grads, not the ones who ended up lateral or worse |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendation\n\n### The critical question is: **What do you want the MBA *for*?**\n\n**If you want to stay in tech** (SWE \u2192 engineering management, product, or senior IC):\n> **Don't go now. Expected value is likely negative.** Your 20-year NPV is probably \u2212$100K to \u2212$200K vs. staying and growing. Senior SWE and engineering management paths don't require MBAs, and the 2 years of compounding experience/equity you lose is substantial. Consider Option E.\n\n**If you want to switch to consulting, finance, or general management:**\n> **Consider deferring 1-2 years (Option D).** The base rate data shows MBA ROI is highest for career switchers AND for people with 5-6 years of pre-MBA experience (vs. your 3). Deferral gives you: higher pre-MBA salary anchor for negotiation, more meaningful work stories for recruiting, and time to confirm this is what you actually want.\n\n**If you want to start a company:**\n> **Probably don't go.** The network value is real but ~$430K is expensive networking. Y Combinator, On Deck, or just building something would give you faster signal.\n\n### Bottom Line\n\n| Scenario | Recommendation | Confidence |\n|----------|---------------|------------|\n| Goal: stay in tech | **Skip or Part-Time (B or C)** | High (75%) |\n| Goal: career switch to finance/consulting | **Defer 1-2 years (D)** | Medium-High (65%) |\n| Goal: entrepreneurship | **Skip, build instead (E)** | Medium (60%) |\n| Goal: uncertain / \"explore\" | **Defer and clarify (D)** | High (70%) |\n\n**The most common mistake is treating MBA admission as a now-or-never decision. Most top programs allow 1-2 year deferrals. If this program does, that is almost certainly the dominant move.** It preserves the option while letting you accumulate earnings, experience, and clarity.",
