Median senior engineer housing ~$2,200/mo\n- SF: ~10.5% effective CA state + local tax. Median comparable housing ~$3,800-$4,500/mo\n- \"Essentials\" includes food, transport, insurance, childcare-if-applicable\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| **A: SF move** | **$95K** | $78K\u2013$112K | $250K \u2192 ~$170K after fed+CA tax \u2192 minus ~$54K housing, ~$21K essentials |\n| **B: Austin stay** | **$100K** | $88K\u2013$115K | $180K \u2192 ~$140K after fed tax (no state) \u2192 minus ~$26K housing, ~$14K essentials |\n| **C: Remote from Austin at ~$215K** | **$120K** | $100K\u2013$138K | SF-ish salary, Austin costs. Typical remote discount is 10-15% |\n| **D: Austin counter-offer ~$210K** | **$115K** | $95K\u2013$130K | Leveraged raise, Austin costs |\n| **E: SF offer, East Bay suburb** | **$105K** | $85K\u2013$120K | CA taxes still apply but housing drops ~$800-1,200/mo |\n\n**Key finding: Option A (the one you're asking about) likely results in *less* disposable income than your current situation.**\n\n---\n\n### KPI 2: 5-Year Cumulative Career Earnings Trajectory\n\nThis captures equity growth, promotion velocity, and network effects.\n\n| Option | Point Estimate (5yr total comp) | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|-------------------------------|--------|-----------|\n| **A: SF move** | **$1.65M** | $1.3M\u2013$2.2M | SF proximity = stronger network, faster job-hopping cycle (~2yr), equity upside. Base rate: SF engineers see ~8-12% annualized comp growth |\n| **B: Austin stay** | **$1.15M** | $1.0M\u2013$1.4M | Austin tech market growing but slower comp escalation. ~5-7% annualized growth |\n| **C: Remote at ~$215K** | **$1.40M** | $1.1M\u2013$1.8M | SF-tier comp trajectory but slightly limited by remote ceiling for promos |\n| **D: Counter-offer $210K** | **$1.25M** | $1.05M\u2013$1.5M | Base rate: 50% of counter-offer acceptees leave within 18 months anyway (trust erosion) |\n| **E: SF, East Bay** | **$1.60M** | $1.25M\u2013$2.1M | Similar to A but slightly less networking serendipity |\n\n**Key finding: SF does offer a meaningfully higher *earnings ceiling*, especially if you job-hop strategically.**\n\n---\n\n### KPI 3: Quality of Life (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Key Factors |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-------------|\n| **A: SF move** | **5.5** | 4\u20137 | Smaller housing, higher stress, new social network from scratch, great food/culture. Partner uprooted socially even if work is fine |\n| **B: Austin stay** | **7.0** | 6\u20138 | Known quantity, established community, more space, but potential regret/stagnation feeling |\n| **C: Remote from Austin** | **8.0** | 6.5\u20139 | Best of both worlds *if* you can avoid remote career penalty. Partner stays happy |\n| **D: Counter-offer** | **6.5** | 5\u20138 | Stays comfortable but counter-offer dynamics can poison the well |\n| **E: East Bay suburb** | **5.0** | 3.5\u20136.5 | Long commute compounds over time. Base rate: commute is #1 predictor of daily dissatisfaction (Kahneman) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Data Point | Source/Evidence |\n|------------|----------------|\n| SF vs. Austin COL differential | ~45-65% higher overall (BLS, Numbeo). Housing specifically ~80-100% higher |\n| Real purchasing power of $250K in SF | Equivalent to roughly $155-170K in Austin (MIT Living Wage Calculator) |\n| Relocation regret rates | ~30% of professionals who relocate for work regret it within 2 years (Worldwide ERC survey) |\n| Counter-offer retention | Only ~40-50% of people who accept counter-offers stay beyond 18 months (Harvard Business Review) |\n| Career earnings premium for SF-based engineers | 15-25% higher *lifetime* earnings even adjusted for COL, driven by network effects and equity access (Levels.fyi longitudinal data) |\n| Remote work penalty on promotions | Remote workers are 38% less likely to receive bonuses and 35% less likely to be promoted (NBER working paper, Bloom et al.) |\n| Partner satisfaction impact on move success | Dual-career couple relocation satisfaction drops significantly when one partner loses social anchoring, even if job is flexible (Brookfield GRS) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring on gross salary** | The $250K vs. $180K comparison is the frame you led with. The $70K gap *feels* enormous but largely evaporates after taxes and COL. Your brain is anchored to the top-line number. |\n| **Binary framing** | You presented this as \"take it or don't.\" This hides at least 3 other viable options (C, D, E). |\n| **Omission of opportunity cost** | Not mentioned: what would you do with the *time and energy* saved by NOT moving? Side projects? Accelerating Austin career? |\n| **Status/prestige bias** | \"SF offer\" and \"$250K\" carry social signaling weight. Would you evaluate this the same if the offer was in, say, Hartford, CT? |\n| **Neglecting partner's revealed preferences** | \"They're flexible\" \u2260 \"they're enthusiastic.\" This is often under-weighted. Research shows partner dissatisfaction is the #1 predictor of relocation failure. |\n| **Present bias** | The immediate raise feels salient. The 5-year career trajectory (where SF *does* win) requires patience and strategic job-hopping to actually capture. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value)\n\n### Composite Expected Value Matrix\n\nWeighting: 30% Disposable Income / 40% Career Trajectory / 30% QoL\n\n| Option | Weighted Score | Rank |\n|--------|---------------|------|\n| **C: Negotiate remote from Austin (~$215K)** | **Highest** | \ud83e\udd47 |\n| **A: Move to SF ($250K)** | **Middle-High** | \ud83e\udd48 |\n| **D: Counter-offer in Austin (~$210K)** | **Middle** | \ud83e\udd49 |\n| **E: SF offer, East Bay** | **Middle-Low** | 4 |\n| **B: Stay at $180K (status quo)** | **Lowest** | 5 |\n\n---\n\n### My Recommendation\n\n**Pursue Option C first, then fall back to Option A with conditions.**\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. **Go back to the SF company and ask for remote/hybrid from Austin.** Frame it as: \"I'm very excited about this role. I'd love to discuss whether Austin-based remote is possible, even if it means adjusting the compensation to $215-225K.\" Success probability: ~35-45% in the current market (higher if it's a company with existing remote infrastructure). This is the highest-EV option by a wide margin.\n\n2. **If they say no to remote**, then the SF move *is* worth taking \u2014 **but only if** you commit to a strategic 2-3 year plan: build SF network, capture equity vesting, job-hop to a $300K+ role, and then decide whether to stay or relocate back. The career trajectory value is real, but only if you play the SF game actively rather than passively sitting in one role.\n\n3. **Do NOT simply stay at $180K and do nothing.** Regardless of outcome, you now have market signal that you're under-compensated. If everything falls through, use the offer to have a genuine conversation with your current employer (though be prepared to leave if they lowball you \u2014 per base rates, counter-offers are fragile).\n\n4. **Have a real conversation with your partner** \u2014 not \"are you flexible?\" but \"on a 1-10 scale, how do you feel about moving to SF, and what would need to be true for it to be a 7+?\"\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n> **The $70K raise is a mirage in gross terms \u2014 it's roughly break-even on disposable income.** The real value of the SF offer is career acceleration and optionality, which is significant but only materializes over 3-5 years with intentional strategy. The highest expected-value move is to capture SF-tier compensation while keeping Austin costs \u2014 negotiate hard for remote before defaulting to the move.",
