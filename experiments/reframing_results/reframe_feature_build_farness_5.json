Typically 4-8 weeks, ~$30-60K |\n| **C** | Responsive redesign | Make current web app fully mobile-responsive. 2-4 weeks, ~$15-30K |\n| **D** | Hybrid app (React Native / Flutter wrapper) | Ship to app stores but share codebase with web. ~2-3 months, ~$100-140K |\n| **E** | Do nothing now** | Invest the $200K elsewhere (sales, features, integrations) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### Assumptions for modeling\n- Current ARR: assumed ~$2-4M (200 customers \u00d7 $10-20K avg, typical B2B SaaS)\n- Baseline NRR without mobile investment: ~105%\n- Baseline new ARR growth from other investments: ~$600K/yr\n\n### KPI 1: Net Revenue Retention Impact (\u0394 NRR, percentage points)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Rationale |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A: Native app | +2.0 pp | [+0.5, +4.0] | Some churn saves, modest expansion |\n| B: PWA | +1.5 pp | [+0.5, +3.0] | Solves 70-80% of the same UX pain |\n| C: Responsive redesign | +0.8 pp | [+0.2, +1.5] | Minimum viable improvement |\n| D: Hybrid app | +1.8 pp | [+0.5, +3.5] | Near-native experience, app store presence |\n| E: Do nothing | +0.0 pp | [-1.0, +0.5] | Risk of slow bleed if competitors ship mobile |\n\n### KPI 2: Incremental New ARR (12 months)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Rationale |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A: Native app | $80K | [$15K, $180K] | \"We have a mobile app\" helps in 10-15% of deals |\n| B: PWA | $40K | [$5K, $100K] | Less compelling in sales demos vs. app store listing |\n| C: Responsive redesign | $15K | [$0, $50K] | Removes objection but doesn't create excitement |\n| D: Hybrid app | $65K | [$10K, $160K] | App store presence + decent experience |\n| E: Do nothing (invest in features) | $90K | [$20K, $200K] | Feature investment often higher ROI for B2B |\n\n### KPI 3: 12-Month ROI\n\n**Total cost estimates** (build + 12-month maintenance):\n\n| Option | Total Cost | Incremental Gross Profit* | ROI Point Est. | 80% CI |\n|--------|-----------|--------------------------|----------------|--------|\n| A: Native | $280K | $140K | **-50%** | [-75%, +30%] |\n| B: PWA | $65K | $95K | **+46%** | [-10%, +180%] |\n| C: Responsive | $30K | $50K | **+67%** | [0%, +200%] |\n| D: Hybrid | $180K | $120K | **-33%** | [-65%, +50%] |\n| E: Do nothing | $0** | $90K | **N/A (baseline)** | \u2014 |\n\n*Incremental gross profit = (\u0394NRR revenue + new ARR) \u00d7 ~75% gross margin. Using midpoint ARR of $3M.*\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Data Point | Source/Basis |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **B2B mobile app adoption** | Typically 20-35% of users actively use a B2B mobile app within 12 months of launch. Most engagement stays on desktop. (Pendo/Mixpanel industry benchmarks) |\n| **Mobile as deal-breaker in B2B** | In enterprise deals, mobile is cited as a \"must-have\" in only ~8-15% of RFPs; it's a \"nice-to-have\" in ~40%. (Gartner buyer surveys) |\n| **Native vs. PWA satisfaction gap** | For productivity/B2B tools, PWAs achieve ~80-90% of native app user satisfaction ratings. The gap is primarily push notifications and offline \u2014 both now supported by PWAs. |\n| **Feature request distortion** | The loudest 10-15% of users drive ~60% of feature requests. Surveys of full user base typically show mobile is a top-3 priority for only 20-30% of B2B users. (ProductBoard data) |\n| **ROI of B2B mobile apps** | Only ~30% of B2B SaaS mobile apps achieve positive ROI within 18 months of launch. (OpenView Partners data) |\n| **Opportunity cost** | $200K in B2B SaaS typically equates to 1-2 senior engineers for a year, or a meaningful sales/CS hire + tooling budget. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Availability bias / Vocal minority** | \"Our users have been asking\" \u2014 how many? 10 users out of 200 feels like \"everyone.\" You likely have no denominator. The framing implies universal demand without evidence. |\n| **Anchoring on the proposed solution** | The question is framed as native app (yes/no), anchoring on the most expensive option and obscuring PWA/responsive alternatives. |\n| **Feature parity illusion** | Implicit assumption that \"mobile app\" means \"native app.\" Users asking for mobile may just want the web app to not be painful on their phone. |\n| **Sunk cost / commitment escalation risk** | A 4-month native build will likely become 6-8 months. Once started, stopping is psychologically difficult. |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | The $200K is presented as a standalone investment, not compared against what else it could fund (the most important missing comparison). |\n| **Pro-innovation bias** | Building something new feels productive. Optimizing what exists feels boring. Teams systematically prefer the former. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### **Do NOT build the native app. Build a PWA instead.**\n\n**Reasoning by expected value:**\n\n```\nExpected Value Comparison (12-month incremental profit minus cost):\n\nOption A (Native):    E[profit] = $140K - $280K = -$140K    \u2190 NEGATIVE EV\nOption B (PWA):       E[profit] = $95K  - $65K  = +$30K     \u2190 BEST RISK-ADJUSTED\nOption C (Responsive): E[profit] = $50K  - $30K  = +$20K     \u2190 SAFE MINIMUM\nOption D (Hybrid):    E[profit] = $120K - $180K = -$60K     \u2190 NEGATIVE EV\nOption E (Do nothing): E[profit] = $90K  - $0    = +$90K     \u2190 HIGHEST RAW EV\n```\n\n### Recommended Action Plan\n\n1. **Immediately (Weeks 1-3, ~$25K):** Do a responsive redesign of critical mobile workflows. Talk to the actual requesting users \u2014 find out what they're trying to do on mobile. Bet it's 2-3 specific tasks, not the full app.\n\n2. **Short-term (Weeks 4-8, ~$35K):** Build a PWA with offline support and push notifications for those 2-3 workflows. Ship to app stores via PWA wrapper (TWA for Android, Safari clip for iOS) to get app store presence.\n\n3. **Invest the remaining $140K** in whatever is actually driving churn and new revenue \u2014 likely core product features, integrations, or sales capacity.\n\n4. **Measure for 6 months.** If mobile PWA adoption exceeds 30% of users AND you're losing deals specifically due to native app absence, revisit native. You'll have real data instead of anecdotes.\n\n### The uncomfortable truth\n\nWith 200 customers in B2B SaaS, a $200K native mobile app has roughly a **70% probability of negative ROI at 12 months** based on base rates. The users asking for \"a mobile app\" almost certainly want \"the app to work well on my phone\" \u2014 which is a $30-60K problem, not a $200K one.",
