Mismatch between \"build mode\" and \"process mode\" is the #1 cause. |\n| **Median time-to-fill for VP Eng is 4-6 months** | Riviera Partners, industry benchmarks for engineering leadership roles |\n| **Series A startups typically have 12-18 months of runway** | A 5-month hiring process + 3-month ramp = consuming 30-45% of your runway timeline before seeing results |\n| **Engineering throughput problems at 15 people are almost always coordination/process problems, not people-count problems** | Brooks's Law; \"adding manpower to a late project makes it later.\" Research from DORA/Accelerate supports this \u2014 process maturity explains more variance than team size. |\n| **CTO-to-VPE transitions are the #1 reported \"regretted hire\" in Y Combinator post-mortems** | YC internal data shared in office hours / blog posts. The CTO often can't let go, or the VPE can't operate with founder-level ambiguity. |\n\n**The base rate alone \u2014 40% failure rate, 5+ months to impact, at a time when speed is existential \u2014 should give serious pause to Option A as an immediate move.**\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How it appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Solutionism / Narrative bias** | \"CTO is overwhelmed \u2192 hire someone to manage\" is a clean story. But the bottleneck may be unclear priorities, technical debt, or poor sprint discipline \u2014 not a missing person. |\n| **Title inflation bias** | Jumping to \"VP\" when the actual need may be a manager or coordinator. At 15 people, a VP of Eng manages ~8-12 engineers \u2014 many excellent candidates will see this as a \"glorified EM\" and churn. |\n| **Anchoring on the org chart** | The implicit mental model is \"Google-shaped org.\" At 15 people, you don't need the same structure. |\n| **Omission neglect** | The question as framed omits Options D and E, which may dominate on expected value. |\n| **Present bias / urgency framing** | \"We can't ship fast enough\" creates pressure to make a big move now. But the highest-EV path may be a faster, cheaper intervention first. |\n| **Survivorship bias** | You've heard stories of great VPE hires transforming companies. You haven't heard about the 40% that failed quietly. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value Analysis)\n\n### Simplified Expected Value Calculation\n\nWeighting: K1 (velocity) = 50%, K2 (speed to impact) = 30%, K3 (cost-efficiency, inverted) = 20%\n\nNormalizing each KPI to a 0-10 scale:\n\n| Option | K1 Score | K2 Score | K3 Score | Weighted EV | Risk-Adj. EV* |\n|--------|----------|----------|----------|-------------|----------------|\n| A: VP Eng | 8 | 3 | 4 | **5.6** | **3.9** (\u00d70.6 for 40% failure rate + long delay risk) |\n| B: Internal EM | 5 | 9 | 9 | **7.0** | **6.3** |\n| C: Senior ICs | 6 | 5 | 2 | **4.9** | **4.4** |\n| **D: Fractional VPE** | **6** | **9** | **8** | **7.3** | **6.9** |\n| E: TPM | 5 | 7 | 7 | **6.1** | **5.5** |\n| F: Status quo | 1 | 10 | 10 | **5.5** | **5.5** |\n\n*Risk-adjusted EV discounts for probability of failure / mis-hire / organizational disruption.*\n\n---\n\n## Final Recommendation\n\n### **Do NOT hire a full-time VP of Engineering right now.**\n\n### **Instead, execute a two-phase plan:**\n\n**Phase 1 (Start this week \u2014 Months 0-3):**\n- **Hire a fractional/interim VP of Engineering** (Option D). Engage someone with a playbook for 15\u219240 person engineering orgs. Task them with:\n  - Installing sprint/planning discipline\n  - Defining engineering levels and career ladders\n  - Identifying whether the real bottleneck is people, process, priorities, or technical debt\n  - Beginning the recruiting pipeline for the permanent hire (if validated)\n- **Simultaneously promote your strongest senior engineer to Tech Lead / EM** (Option B) to start building internal management muscle.\n\n**Phase 2 (Months 3-6):**\n- If the fractional VPE validates that a full-time VP Eng is the right next hire (not a given), you now have:\n  - A clearer job spec based on actual gaps identified\n  - A warm pipeline already started\n  - An internal EM who can partner with (not be threatened by) the new hire\n  - Data on whether velocity actually improved from process changes alone\n\n**Why this dominates:**\n- **Faster to impact** (weeks, not months)\n- **70% cheaper** in the evaluation period\n- **Reversible** \u2014 if it doesn't work, you've lost $50K and 3 months, not $200K+ and 6 months on a mis-hire\n- **Reduces the #1 risk** \u2014 hiring the wrong VPE before you know what you actually need\n\n> **The meta-insight:** At 15 people post-Series A, your bottleneck is almost certainly not a missing person in a missing box on an org chart. It's missing systems. A fractional leader installs the systems. Then you'll know whether you need the person.",
