Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n| KPI | Definition | Measurement |\n|-----|-----------|-------------|\n| **Incremental Net Revenue (12-month)** | Additional ARR attributable to mobile app minus cost | $ gained from reduced churn + upsell + new wins, minus $200K + ongoing maintenance |\n| **Customer Retention Lift** | Change in annual logo churn rate | % point improvement in 12-month retention |\n| **Mobile Engagement Rate** | % of active users engaging via mobile weekly | Tracked via analytics, baseline vs. post-launch |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Options Identified\n\n| # | Option | Description |\n|---|--------|-------------|\n| A | **Build native app** | 4 months, $200K, iOS + Android |\n| B | **Progressive Web App (PWA)** | Optimize existing web app for mobile; ~4-6 weeks, ~$30-50K |\n| C | **Responsive redesign** | Make current web app fully mobile-responsive; ~3-4 weeks, ~$20-40K |\n| D | **Do nothing now** | Maintain status quo; revisit in 6 months with more data |\n| E | **Hybrid app (React Native/Flutter)** | Cross-platform app; ~2.5 months, ~$100-130K |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Point Estimates & Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: Incremental Net Revenue (12 months)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A: Native app | +$80K | (-$100K to +$300K) | High cost; revenue upside uncertain without proven mobile demand signal |\n| B: PWA | +$60K | (-$10K to +$150K) | Lower cost floor dramatically improves downside |\n| C: Responsive redesign | +$30K | (+$0K to +$80K) | Modest improvement, very safe |\n| D: Do nothing | $0 | (-$50K to +$10K) | Risk of churn from frustrated users asking for mobile |\n| E: Hybrid app | +$70K | (-$60K to +$250K) | Moderate cost, slightly lower quality than native |\n\n### KPI 2: Customer Retention Lift (percentage points)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A: Native | +2.0 pp | (+0.5 to +4.0) |\n| B: PWA | +1.5 pp | (+0.5 to +3.0) |\n| C: Responsive | +0.8 pp | (+0.2 to +1.5) |\n| D: Do nothing | 0 pp | (-1.0 to +0.5) |\n| E: Hybrid | +1.8 pp | (+0.5 to +3.5) |\n\n### KPI 3: Weekly Mobile Engagement Rate (% of MAUs)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A: Native | 25% | (12% to 40%) |\n| B: PWA | 18% | (8% to 30%) |\n| C: Responsive | 10% | (5% to 18%) |\n| D: Do nothing | 3% | (1% to 6%) |\n| E: Hybrid | 22% | (10% to 35%) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **B2B mobile app adoption**: Only **~20-30% of B2B SaaS companies** with <500 customers have a dedicated mobile app (Productboard 2023 survey). You'd be *early*, not late.\n- **B2B mobile engagement**: Typical B2B apps see **15-25% weekly active usage** among customers who install; but **only 30-50% of eligible users ever install** the app (Mixpanel benchmarks).\n- **Feature request \u2260 usage**: Research from Pendo/ProductPlan shows that **~60-65% of features built from user requests see lower-than-expected adoption**. \"Asking for\" mobile \u2260 \"will use daily.\"\n- **Churn impact of mobile**: Studies from Gainsight suggest mobile access in B2B correlates with **1-3 percentage point retention improvement**, but causality is ambiguous (engaged customers both ask for mobile AND retain better).\n- **PWA effectiveness**: Google case studies show PWAs achieve **~70-80% of native app engagement** at **~20-25% of the cost** for content-consumption and light-interaction use cases.\n- **Cost overruns**: The median software project runs **30-50% over budget and timeline** (Standish Group CHAOS report). That $200K / 4 months is more likely $260K / 5.5 months.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Vocal minority bias** | \"Our users have been asking\" \u2014 How many? 10 users = 5% of base. Are they your *highest-value* accounts or your most vocal? |\n| **Anchoring on the binary** | The question is framed as \"build it or don't\" \u2014 excluding the 3 intermediate options that may dominate both |\n| **Sunk cost / commitment escalation risk** | A $200K/4-month project creates momentum that makes it hard to kill mid-build if signals are bad |\n| **Pro-innovation bias** | Building a native app *feels* like progress and pleases the team. Responsive redesign feels unsexy but may capture 60% of the value at 15% of the cost |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | 4 months of engineering on mobile = 4 months *not* spent on the core web product. What's the next-best use of $200K and those dev-months? |\n| **WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is)** | No data presented on: which customers are asking, what they'd do on mobile, current mobile browser analytics, or competitive pressure |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendation\n\n### **Don't build the native app now. Start with Option B (PWA) or C (Responsive Redesign) as a staged approach.**\n\n**Rationale by expected value:**\n\n```\nOption A (Native):  EV = +$80K, but 80% CI includes -$100K downside\n                     Risk-adjusted EV \u2248 +$50K (accounting for overruns)\n                     \nOption B (PWA):     EV = +$60K, with -$10K downside floor\n                     Risk-adjusted EV \u2248 +$55K\n                     \nOption C (Responsive): EV = +$30K, near-zero downside\n                     Risk-adjusted EV \u2248 +$28K\n```\n\n**Option B dominates on a risk-adjusted basis.** Nearly equivalent upside to native, with 1/5th the downside and 1/4 the cost.\n\n### Recommended Playbook\n\n| Phase | Action | Timeline | Cost | Gate to Next Phase |\n|-------|--------|----------|------|--------------------|\n| **Phase 0** | Instrument current mobile browser usage; survey the *specific* requesting customers on use cases | 2 weeks | ~$0 | Proceed if >15% of users show mobile sessions OR >30% of customers confirm mobile need |\n| **Phase 1** | Build PWA or responsive redesign | 4-6 weeks | $30-50K | Proceed if mobile WAU >10% and retention signal positive after 3 months |\n| **Phase 2** | Build native/hybrid app informed by real usage data | 3-4 months | $120-180K | N/A \u2014 now you have data to justify the spend |\n\n### Why this is better than jumping to native:\n- **You preserve optionality** \u2014 $150K+ stays available for other investments\n- **You generate real data** \u2014 mobile usage patterns will *design* the native app better\n- **You ship faster** \u2014 customers see responsiveness in weeks, not months\n- **You avoid the base-rate trap** \u2014 60%+ chance the native app would underwhelm relative to expectations\n\n> **Bottom line:** The question isn't \"should we go mobile?\" (probably yes). The question is \"should we spend $200K before we know what mobile usage actually looks like?\" The answer is no. Spend $40K to learn, then spend $150K wisely.",
