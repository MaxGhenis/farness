The no-state-income-tax advantage alone is worth ~$15-18K/yr.\n\n### KPI 2: Expected Total Comp in 3 Years\n\nBase rates (Levels.fyi data for senior \u2192 staff trajectory):\n- SF senior engineers in top-tier companies see **15-25% TC growth over 3 years** (network effects, equity refreshers, poaching market)\n- Austin senior engineers see **8-15% TC growth over 3 years** (growing but thinner market)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 SF | **$320K** | $270K \u2013 $400K |\n| B \u2014 Stay Austin | **$210K** | $190K \u2013 $240K |\n| C \u2014 Negotiate Austin | **$250K** | $220K \u2013 $285K |\n| D \u2014 Remote SF comp | **$280K** | $240K \u2013 $340K |\n| E \u2014 New search | **$260K** | $215K \u2013 $310K |\n\n**Key finding:** SF has the highest career capital ceiling. The density of hiring managers, VCs, and staff+ engineers creates compounding optionality.\n\n### KPI 3: Life Satisfaction (1-10)\n\nBase rates: Relocation satisfaction research shows ~40% of relocators report *lower* life satisfaction at 12 months (disrupted social networks, adjustment costs). Remote partners of relocators report moderate isolation effects.\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A \u2014 SF | **6.0** | 4.5 \u2013 7.5 |\n| B \u2014 Stay Austin | **7.0** | 6.0 \u2013 8.0 |\n| C \u2014 Negotiate Austin | **7.8** | 6.5 \u2013 8.5 |\n| D \u2014 Remote SF comp | **7.5** | 6.0 \u2013 8.5 |\n| E \u2014 New search | **6.8** | 5.5 \u2013 8.0 |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Data Point | Source/Logic |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| SF vs. Austin COL differential: **45-55%** | BLS, Numbeo, multiple indices |\n| $250K SF \u2248 **$160-170K Austin** in purchasing power | After tax + COL adjustment |\n| Counter-offer success rate: **~50-70%** when holding a credible competing offer | Multiple hiring/HR surveys |\n| Remote negotiation success for SF roles: **~30-40%** and rising post-COVID | Hired.com, Blind surveys |\n| Senior \u2192 Staff promotion rate in 3 years: **~20-30%** at top SF firms | Levels.fyi, internal data leaks |\n| Relocation regret rate: **~25-35%** at 1 year | Mobility research (Atlas Van Lines, Allied) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring** | \"$250K vs $180K\" creates a $70K gap that *feels* enormous but is largely illusory after COL adjustment. The nominal gap anchors you. |\n| **Binary framing** | \"Should I take it?\" excludes negotiate-in-place, negotiate-remote, and search options. This is the biggest distortion. |\n| **Prestige bias / social proof** | \"SF offer\" carries implicit status signaling. Ask: would you feel the same about a $250K offer in a less prestigious city? |\n| **Neglect of partner externalities** | \"They're flexible\" \u2260 \"they prefer this.\" Remote workers often suffer from relocations more than acknowledged. Under-weighted in your framing. |\n| **Status quo bias** (counterpoint) | You may also be rationalizing staying because it's comfortable. The career capital argument for SF is real. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Expected Value Recommendation\n\n### Composite Scoring (weighted: 30% income, 40% career capital, 30% life satisfaction)\n\n| Option | Weighted Score | Rank |\n|--------|---------------|------|\n| **D \u2014 Negotiate remote/Austin-based at SF comp** | **8.4** | \ud83e\udd47 |\n| **C \u2014 Use offer to negotiate Austin raise** | **7.9** | \ud83e\udd48 |\n| **A \u2014 Accept SF, relocate** | **7.1** | \ud83e\udd49 |\n| **E \u2014 Decline + active search** | **6.8** | 4 |\n| **B \u2014 Stay, do nothing** | **6.2** | 5 |\n\n### My Recommendation\n\n**Play this in sequence, not as a binary:**\n\n> **Step 1:** Negotiate with the SF company for a remote or hybrid-from-Austin arrangement at $225-240K. Success probability: ~30-40%, but the payoff is the dominant option across all three KPIs.\n>\n> **Step 2 (if Step 1 fails):** Use the SF offer to negotiate with your current employer. Target $205-220K. You have extraordinary leverage right now.\n>\n> **Step 3 (if both fail):** Then and only then, evaluate the SF relocation on its merits \u2014 **primarily as a career capital play, not a financial one.** If you're targeting staff+ and the SF company has a strong brand and equity upside, it can be worth the short-term discretionary income hit. If it's a lateral move at a mid-tier company, the math doesn't work.\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n**The SF offer is most valuable as a *lever*, not necessarily as a *destination*.** The $70K nominal raise is a mirage \u2014 you're roughly break-even or slightly worse on purchasing power. The real value is either (a) unlocking remote-equivalent comp or (b) forcing your Austin employer's hand. Only take the relocation if the career acceleration story is compelling enough to justify 2-3 years of lower discretionary income as an investment.",
