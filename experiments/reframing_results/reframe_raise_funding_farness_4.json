But conditional on macro + execution |\n| C: Wait 12mo | **32%** | 0\u201348% | Huge variance: either spectacular valuation or fire-sale/death |\n| D: Small bridge | **43%** | 33\u201351% | Minimal dilution now, better position for priced round in 6mo |\n| E: Reach profitability | **52%** | 38\u201360% | Least dilution *if feasible*, but may sacrifice growth |\n\n### K2: Probability of Survival to 36 Months\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A: Raise now | **90%** | 82\u201395% | 3+ years of runway solves most near-term existential risk |\n| B: Wait 6mo | **75%** | 60\u201385% | 6 months of runway remaining when you go to market; fundraising takes 3-4 months |\n| C: Wait 12mo | **45%** | 25\u201360% | Raising with <2 months cash is a known death spiral condition |\n| D: Small bridge | **82%** | 70\u201390% | Buys time but doesn't fully de-risk |\n| E: Reach profitability | **70%** | 50\u201385% | Depends entirely on whether unit economics support it at current scale |\n\n### K3: Expected MRR at Month 24\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A: Raise now | **$3.5M** | $2.0\u20135.5M | Capital fuels growth; 15% MoM will decay but capital sustains investment |\n| B: Wait 6mo | **$2.8M** | $1.2\u20135.0M | Growth may slow without capital for hiring/marketing in months 1-6 |\n| C: Wait 12mo | **$1.5M** | $0\u20134.5M | High risk of survival-mode decisions destroying growth |\n| D: Small bridge | **$3.0M** | $1.8\u20134.8M | Moderate fuel, reasonable trajectory |\n| E: Reach profitability | **$1.8M** | $1.0\u20133.0M | Deliberately trading growth for margin |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n**These are the numbers that should terrify you out of waiting:**\n\n- **Median time to close a fundraise**: 3-6 months from first meeting to wire. You don't have 12 months of \"runway then raise.\" You have **6-7 months before you must start the process**.\n\n- **Startups that die with \"good metrics\" because they timed fundraising wrong**: ~25-30% of startup deaths are attributed to running out of cash / failing to raise in time (CB Insights post-mortems).\n\n- **Month-over-month growth decay**: 15% MoM is exceptional. Base rate for sustaining >10% MoM for 6+ months at $500K MRR is roughly **30-40%**. Growth rates almost always regress toward the mean. Your best metric is *right now*.\n\n- **VC market cyclicality**: The median time between \"hot\" and \"cold\" funding markets is 12-18 months. Current interest is a *perishable asset*.\n\n- **Valuation premium for waiting 6 months at similar-stage companies**: Typically 1.3-1.8x *if growth holds*. But the expected value is lower because of the probability growth doesn't hold.\n\n- **Dilution difference in practice**: Raising at $200M vs. $300M on a $20M round = **10% vs. 6.7% dilution**. You are risking company survival for **3.3 percentage points of equity**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears | Impact |\n|------|---------------|--------|\n| **Anchoring on valuation** | The question frames this as a valuation optimization problem. It is actually a *survival and expected value* problem. | Causes you to overweight a number (valuation) that matters far less than the probability of being alive. |\n| **Overconfidence in growth persistence** | \"We're growing 15% MoM\" assumes this continues. Founders systematically overestimate the durability of current growth rates. | Makes waiting seem less risky than it is. |\n| **Neglect of the denominator** | 3.3% less dilution \u00d7 probability everything goes right vs. survival risk. People compare the \"good\" scenarios, not the expected values. | Classic \"comparing the peaks, not the distributions.\" |\n| **Present bias (inverted)** | Oddly, this is *future bias* \u2014 overvaluing a hypothetical future valuation over certain, available capital now. | The bird-in-hand heuristic exists for a reason. |\n| **Framing as binary** | \"Raise now vs. wait\" obscures options D and E entirely. | You haven't considered the full option space. |\n| **Winner's narrative bias** | You're probably thinking of companies that waited and got huge valuations. You're not thinking of the ones that waited and died, because they're not around to tell the story. | Survivorship bias in your mental reference class. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Expected Value Recommendation\n\n### Expected Value Calculation (simplified composite score)\n\nWeighting: K1 (25%), K2 (40%), K3 (35%) \u2014 survival deserves the heaviest weight because it's multiplicative with everything else.\n\n| Option | Weighted EV Score | Risk-Adjusted Rank |\n|--------|------------------|--------------------|\n| **A: Raise now** | **0.81** | **\ud83e\udd47 1st** |\n| D: Small bridge | 0.74 | 2nd |\n| B: Wait 6mo | 0.62 | 3rd |\n| E: Profitability | 0.59 | 4th |\n| C: Wait 12mo | 0.35 | 5th |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n### **Raise the $20M now. This is not a close call.**\n\nHere is the core logic:\n\n> **You are contemplating risking a 90% survival probability for a 75% survival probability in exchange for ~3 percentage points of equity.**\n\nThat is a bad trade on any rational expected-value basis.\n\n**Three things are true simultaneously:**\n1. **15% MoM at $500K MRR is a peak signal.** VCs are pattern-matching to this. In 6 months, if growth dips to 8% MoM (which base rates say is *likely*), the $200M valuation may not be available at all \u2014 let alone $300M.\n2. **12 months of runway is not 12 months of optionality.** After accounting for fundraise duration (3-5 months) and the need to show progress *during* the raise, your actual decision window is **the next 8-10 weeks**.\n3. **The valuation you're being offered is not \"low.\"** $200M on $6M ARR is a 33x multiple. That's top-quartile. The framing that you'd be \"leaving money on the table\" is itself a cognitive distortion.\n\n**If you're genuinely uncomfortable with dilution**, consider a hybrid: raise $15M at $200M now and structure for a small extension at a step-up. But do not walk away from committed capital in a market where capital availability can vanish in a quarter.\n\n> *\"The graveyard of startups is full of companies that had great metrics and decided to wait for a better valuation.\"*\n\n**Raise. Now. This week. Before the market, your metrics, or VC attention changes.**",
