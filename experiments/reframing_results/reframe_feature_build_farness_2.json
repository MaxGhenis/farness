The \"everyone wants an app\" signal is often louder than actual usage.\n- **Feature request reliability**: Studies (Intercom, ProductPlan) show that **fewer than 20% of loudly-requested features** drive material retention or revenue impact. Vocal requesters \u2260 representative sample.\n- **B2B native app ROI at <500 customers**: At 200 customers, the per-customer cost of a native app is **$1,000/customer** for build alone. Base rate for positive ROI within 12 months at this scale is roughly **20-30%** (based on SaaS benchmarks from OpenView Partners).\n- **PWA vs. native in B2B**: PWAs achieve **60-80% of native engagement** in enterprise contexts at **20-30% of the cost** (Google case studies, Gartner).\n- **Maintenance burden**: Native apps typically cost **30-50% of initial build annually** to maintain; PWAs cost **15-25%**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Availability bias** | \"Users have been asking\" \u2014 vocal minority anchors the perceived demand. How many of the 200 customers actually asked? If it's 15, that's 7.5%. |\n| **Anchoring on the presented option** | The question frames this as binary (build native app vs. don't). This suppresses cheaper intermediate options (PWA, responsive redesign). |\n| **IKEA effect / commitment bias** | 4 months and $200K feels like a \"real\" investment, which paradoxically makes it feel more serious and therefore more likely to work. |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | $200K and 4 months of engineering time could fund 2-3 other features. What's the next-best use of those resources? |\n| **Pro-innovation bias** | \"Native app\" sounds modern and impressive. It's easy to overweight the signal value to investors/prospects vs. actual user value. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Expected Value Recommendation\n\n### Calculating simplified expected value (12-month horizon)\n\nAssumptions: Average revenue per customer = ~$15K ARR (mid-market B2B SaaS median). 200 customers = $3M ARR.\n\n| Option | Expected Incremental Revenue | Total Cost (Yr 1) | Expected Net Value | Risk-Adjusted EV* |\n|--------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| A \u2013 Native | $90K (+3pp \u00d7 $3M) | $280K | **-$190K** | **-$210K** |\n| B \u2013 PWA | $60K (+2pp \u00d7 $3M) | $65K | **-$5K** | **+$5K** |\n| C \u2013 Responsive | $30K (+1pp \u00d7 $3M) | $40K | **-$10K** | **-$5K** |\n| D \u2013 Do nothing | $0 | $0 | **$0** | **-$15K** (churn risk) |\n| E \u2013 Hybrid | $75K (+2.5pp \u00d7 $3M) | $190K | **-$115K** | **-$130K** |\n\n*Risk-adjusted EV accounts for variance, probability of delays, and downside scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfc6 Recommendation: **Option B \u2014 Build a Progressive Web App (PWA)**\n\n### Why:\n\n1. **Best risk-adjusted expected value.** It's the only option with a plausible positive EV within 12 months at your current scale. Native app needs ~18 months just to break even \u2014 and that's the *point estimate*, not the downside.\n\n2. **Fastest feedback loop.** Shipped in 6-8 weeks, you get *actual mobile usage data* within 3 months. This converts the decision from a $200K bet to a $50K experiment.\n\n3. **Preserves optionality.** If PWA mobile engagement exceeds 25%, you now have a *data-backed case* for native at a later stage (likely when you're at 400+ customers and the unit economics improve 2x).\n\n4. **Addresses the real ask.** Most B2B \"we want a mobile app\" requests are actually \"I want it to work well on my phone.\" A well-executed PWA with offline support and push notifications closes 70-80% of that gap.\n\n### Immediate next steps:\n- **Validate demand**: Survey all 200 customers \u2014 how many would use mobile weekly? For what tasks?\n- **Scope the PWA**: Focus on the 2-3 highest-value mobile use cases (e.g., notifications, dashboards, approvals)\n- **Define a kill/upgrade threshold**: \"If >25% weekly mobile engagement at 3 months \u2192 begin native app planning. If <10% \u2192 mobile is not a priority.\"\n\n> **Bottom line:** At 200 customers, a native app is a $280K answer to a $50K question. Build the PWA, measure real behavior, and let the data tell you when (and whether) to go native.",
