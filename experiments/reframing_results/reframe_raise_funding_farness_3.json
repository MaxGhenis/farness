Median SaaS company decelerates to 8-10% MoM within 6 months at this scale. (Source: Bessemer Cloud Index, ChartMogul SaaS benchmarks) |\n| **VC funding environment reversion** | In 2021-2022, available Series A/B rounds contracted by **40-60%** within 6-month windows. Fundraising markets are *reflexive*, not stable. |\n| **Startups that die with \"12 months of runway\"** | **~30-40%** of startups with \u226412 months runway fail to raise their next round. (CB Insights, Carta data) The 12-month clock is not safe\u2014it's a **warning light**. |\n| **Dilution difference: raising at $200M vs $400M** | On a $20M raise: 10% vs 5% dilution. The difference is **5 percentage points** of equity. At a $1B exit, that's $50M. At a $100M exit (more common), it's $5M. |\n| **Startups offered a term sheet that passed and later raised higher** | Roughly **50-60%** succeed at this. The other 40-50% raise at the same or *lower* valuation, or don't raise at all. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Shows Up Here |\n|------|---------------------|\n| **Anchoring on valuation** | The question is framed as \"$200M vs. a higher number.\" But valuation is an *input*, not an *outcome*. The question should be about expected wealth and survival. |\n| **Overconfidence in growth persistence** | \"We're growing 15% MoM\" implies this will continue. The base rate says it almost certainly won't. Your mental model has you at $2.7M MRR in 12 months. Reality median is ~$1.2-1.5M MRR. |\n| **Narrative bias / Hindsight from survivors** | You've heard stories of founders who waited and got a 3x better valuation. You are not hearing from the dead companies who waited and got nothing. |\n| **Denominator neglect** | Obsessing over dilution percentage while ignoring the probability-weighted size of the pie. 48% of a $600M company >> 58% of a $0 company. |\n| **Loss aversion framed as \"leaving money on the table\"** | The 5% dilution difference *feels* like a loss. But the 35% probability of a significantly worse outcome from waiting doesn't trigger the same emotional response. |\n| **Present bias reversal** | Ironically, \"waiting\" feels prudent and patient, but it's actually the *riskier* gamble dressed up as discipline. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation (Expected Value Analysis)\n\n### Simplified Expected Value Calculation\n\n**Metric: Expected Founder Wealth = P(survival) \u00d7 E(enterprise value) \u00d7 E(equity %)**\n\n| Option | Calculation | Expected Value |\n|--------|------------|----------------|\n| **A: Raise now** | 0.92 \u00d7 $600M \u00d7 0.48 | **$265M** |\n| **B: Wait** | 0.65 \u00d7 $450M \u00d7 0.44 | **$129M** |\n| **C: Small bridge** | 0.80 \u00d7 $500M \u00d7 0.47 | **$188M** |\n| **D: Profitability** | 0.55 \u00d7 $300M \u00d7 0.52 | **$86M** |\n\n---\n\n### Verdict: **Raise now. Option A. Decisively.**\n\nThe expected value of raising now is **more than 2x** the expected value of waiting, driven overwhelmingly by survival probability, not valuation arithmetic.\n\n### The core logic in one paragraph:\n\n> You are debating whether to trade 5 percentage points of dilution for a ~35% increase in the probability that your company *continues to exist*. This is not a close call. The fundraising environment is available *now*. Your growth rate is exceptional *now*. VCs are interested *now*. All three of these things are stochastic and mean-reverting. The founders who say \"I wish I'd waited for a better valuation\" are outnumbered 10:1 by founders who say \"I wish I'd taken the money when it was there.\" **Cash in the bank is a strategic weapon, not a dilution event.** Raise the $20M, deploy it to sustain growth, and make the valuation conversation irrelevant by building a company worth $1B+.\n\n### If you want to optimize on the margin:\nNegotiate the *terms*, not the *timing*. Fight for pro-rata rights, minimal liquidation preferences, board composition, and anti-dilution provisions. These matter far more than whether the pre-money is $200M or $250M.",
