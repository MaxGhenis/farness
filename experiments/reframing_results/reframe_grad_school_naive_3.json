  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis\n\nThis is a big decision, so let me walk through it honestly rather than just cheerleading.\n\n## The Real Cost\n\nLet's be clear-eyed about what you're actually paying:\n\n- **Tuition:** ~$160K\n- **Lost wages:** ~$260K (2 years of salary)\n- **Total cost:** ~$420K+\n\nThat's the real number you need to recover.\n\n## The Honest Questions You Need to Answer\n\n**1. WHY do you want the MBA?**\n\nThis is the most important question. Good reasons:\n- You want to switch into management consulting, finance, or product management\n- You want to break into a specific industry where an MBA is a genuine credential gate\n- You want to build a network in a specific domain\n- You have a clear post-MBA career target\n\nBad reasons:\n- You're bored or restless (cheaper solutions exist)\n- Vague \"career advancement\"\n- Prestige/status\n- \"I don't know what else to do\"\n\n**2. Which program specifically?**\n\n\"Good\" matters a lot here. The MBA ROI curve is steep:\n- **Top 10 (M7 + a few):** Usually worth it financially. Strong recruiting pipelines, brand opens doors for decades.\n- **Top 11-25:** Situational. Depends heavily on your goal and the school's specific strengths.\n- **Below top 25:** Very hard to justify financially for someone already earning $130K in tech.\n\n**3. Can you get where you want WITHOUT the MBA?**\n\nAt $130K with 3 years in software engineering, you're already on a strong trajectory. Senior engineers at top companies make $200-400K+. If your goal is just \"more money,\" staying in engineering and leveling up may get you there faster and without $420K in opportunity cost.\n\n## When I'd Say GO\n\n- It's a top ~15 program\n- You have a clear career pivot goal (consulting, product, finance, entrepreneurship with a cohort)\n- You've genuinely hit a ceiling that the MBA specifically breaks through\n- You've talked to actual alumni and confirmed the outcomes are real\n\n## When I'd Say DON'T GO\n\n- You're mainly attracted to the experience or the break from work\n- You want to stay in software engineering (the MBA adds almost nothing)\n- The program is ranked below ~20 and you're financing it with debt\n- You can't articulate a specific post-MBA path\n\n## My Honest Take\n\nMost software engineers making $130K at 3 years of experience will earn more over their career by **staying in tech and growing** than by getting an MBA, unless they have a specific career change in mind. The MBA is powerful, but it's a tool\u2014and expensive tools you don't need are just expensive.\n\n**So my actual recommendation:** Don't decide based on \"should I get an MBA?\" Decide based on \"what do I want my career to look like in 10 years, and is this the best path to get there?\"\n\nIf you share the specific program and your goal, I can give you a sharper answer.",
