  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your Startup Decision\n\nThis is a genuinely hard decision, and I want to be honest with you rather than just cheerleading. Let me lay out how I'd think about it.\n\n## What's actually at stake financially\n\n- You're giving up **~$350K/year** (likely more with equity vesting)\n- $200K in savings sounds like a lot but it's **roughly 12-18 months of runway** for a family in a GVHCOL area, less if you're also funding the startup with it\n- You have a 2-year-old, which means you're in the most expensive childcare years with the least schedule flexibility\n\n## The honest case for NOT quitting yet\n\n- **Developer tools is a tough business.** Monetization is notoriously hard. The market is crowded. Most successful devtools companies took years to find product-market fit.\n- **You haven't mentioned validation.** Do you have users? Design partners? A waitlist? \"Passionate about an idea\" and \"have evidence of demand\" are very different stages.\n- **Your Google role is actually an asset.** Credibility, network, access to potential design partners and future hires. You lose some of that the day you leave.\n- **A 2-year-old means your spouse is also under pressure.** Being the sole income earner with a toddler is stressful in ways that are hard to anticipate.\n\n## The honest case for quitting\n\n- Part-time startups in competitive spaces usually lose to full-time founders\n- If you're senior enough to make $350K at Google, your time is genuinely your most valuable asset\n- Developer tools often require deep building before you have anything to show \u2014 hard to do nights and weekends\n- At some point you have to actually jump\n\n## My actual recommendation\n\n**Don't quit yet. But set a concrete 3-6 month plan to earn the right to quit.**\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. **Validate before you build.** Talk to 30+ potential users. Can you get 5 companies to say \"I would pay for this / I would use this today\"? Do this on evenings and weekends.\n2. **Set a clear quit trigger.** Something like: \"If I have X design partners and Y level of conviction by [date], I go.\" This prevents both indefinite delay and premature leaping.\n3. **Build your financial buffer.** Every month you stay, you're adding to runway. Aim for 18-24 months of family expenses *separate* from startup costs.\n4. **Explore whether Google has a leave policy.** Some roles allow unpaid leave. A 6-month leave of absence is enormously less risky than quitting.\n5. **Have the real conversation with your spouse.** Not \"would you support me\" (which pressures them to say yes) but \"here's what this actually looks like for our family financially and practically \u2014 what concerns do you have?\"\n\n## The uncomfortable truth\n\nMost people in your position who ask \"should I quit?\" are really asking for permission to do the thing they've already decided to do. If that's you, be honest with yourself about it.\n\nBut passion isn't evidence. The best founders I've seen don't leap on faith \u2014 they **de-risk methodically and then leap on evidence**. You're in a rare position where you can afford to do that. Use it.\n\n---\n\nWhat stage is the idea actually at? That would change my advice significantly.",
