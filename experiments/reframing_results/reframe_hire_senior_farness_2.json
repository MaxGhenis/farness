This is the single most important number in this analysis.\n- **CTO/VP of Eng conflict:** In startups under 30 people, introducing a VP Eng frequently creates role ambiguity. ~30-40% of these pairings result in one person departing within a year (anecdotal but widely reported by Notion Capital, a16z).\n- **Brooks's Law empirical data:** Adding engineers to a team of 8-15 without proportional management investment typically produces **zero net throughput gain** for 3-6 months and sometimes a sustained decrease (Microsoft Research, \"The Mythical Man-Month\" follow-up studies).\n- **Fractional exec effectiveness:** Emerging data from firms like Bolster and The Interim CEO suggests ~70% satisfaction rates, but primarily as a *bridge* \u2014 they rarely solve the problem permanently.\n- **Engineering Manager ROI:** Stripe's internal data (publicly discussed) found that the single highest-leverage hire for teams of 6-15 engineers is usually a **first-line engineering manager**, not a VP.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Seniority Bias / Title Inflation** | The framing jumps to \"VP of Engineering\" \u2014 the most senior, expensive option \u2014 without establishing that the bottleneck requires VP-level intervention. At 15 people you likely have 5-10 engineers. That's one team, not a department. |\n| **Single-Cause Fallacy** | \"CTO is overwhelmed\" is treated as the diagnosis. But *why* is the CTO overwhelmed? People management? Project management? Technical debt? Hiring? Each root cause points to a different solution. |\n| **Anchoring on Roles, Not Problems** | The question is framed as \"should we hire X role?\" rather than \"what is actually throttling throughput?\" The CTO may be overwhelmed by work that a PM, a Tech Lead, or better processes would solve. |\n| **Narrative Bias (Hero Hire)** | There's an implicit story: \"We'll bring in a seasoned VP who will fix everything.\" This is the classic startup hero-hire trap. It feels decisive and legible to the board. It is often wrong. |\n| **Survivorship Bias** | You're likely pattern-matching on companies where a VP Eng hire worked spectacularly. You don't hear about the (more numerous) cases where it created 6 months of chaos. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Primary Recommendation: **Option B + D (Hybrid) \u2014 Eng Manager + Process Fix**\n\n**Expected Value Calculation (simplified, on throughput):**\n\n| Option | E[Throughput] \u00d7 P(Success within 12mo) | Risk-Adjusted Output | Cost |\n|--------|----------------------------------------|---------------------|------|\n| A: VP Eng | 18 \u00d7 0.50 = 9.0 | **9.0** | $350K + high org risk |\n| B: Eng Mgr | 15 \u00d7 0.75 = 11.3 | **11.3** | $200K |\n| C: Fractional | 14 \u00d7 0.70 = 9.8 | **9.8** | $150K |\n| **B+D: EM + Process** | 16 \u00d7 0.75 = 12.0 | **12.0** | $350K combined |\n| E: Do nothing | 11 \u00d7 0.50 = 5.5 | **5.5** | $175K/IC |\n\n### Specific Action Plan\n\n1. **Immediately (Week 1-2):** Diagnose the *actual* bottleneck. Have the CTO time-log for two weeks. Categorize: people management, project prioritization, code review, architecture decisions, hiring, meetings. This changes everything.\n\n2. **Month 1-2:** Hire a **strong Engineering Manager** (not VP). This person runs standups, 1:1s, sprint planning, and hiring pipelines. This alone likely frees 40-60% of the CTO's time.\n\n3. **Month 1-3:** Simultaneously hire a **Technical PM or improve project management processes**. Much of what feels like \"engineering bottleneck\" is actually prioritization chaos.\n\n4. **Month 6-9:** *Reassess.* If you've grown to 20-25 engineers and now have 2-3 teams, **then** a VP of Engineering becomes the right hire \u2014 and you'll have a much clearer job description, the EM can help evaluate candidates, and your CTO will know what they actually need in a partner.\n\n### Why NOT the VP Eng now?\n\n> A VP of Engineering at a 15-person startup with a ~8-person eng team is **organizational premature optimization.** The failure rate is too high (~50%), the cost is too steep, the time-to-impact is too slow, and the most likely outcome is 4-6 months of expensive turbulence followed by either the VP or the CTO leaving. You are paying VP-level money to solve an Engineering Manager-level problem.\n\n### The Exception\n\nHire the VP Eng **now** if and only if: (a) you personally know a specific candidate who has worked with your CTO before and they have a proven relationship, AND (b) you are planning to triple the eng team in the next 12 months. A known quantity with a pre-existing trust relationship inverts the base rates entirely.",
