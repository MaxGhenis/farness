Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **Expected Net Worth Impact (ENWI)** | \u0394 in household net worth vs. staying, probability-weighted | 5 years |\n| **Career Optionality Score (COS)** | Quality of best available next role if the venture fails (salary \u00d7 role desirability, indexed to current = 100) | 3 years |\n| **Life Satisfaction Index (LSI)** | Self-reported wellbeing covering autonomy, stress, family time, purpose (scale 1\u201310) | Ongoing, measured at Year 2 |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Options Identified\n\n| # | Option | Description |\n|---|--------|-------------|\n| **A** | Stay at Google | Continue current role; work on idea as a hobby |\n| **B** | Quit and bootstrap | Full-time on startup, fund from $200K savings |\n| **C** | Quit with external funding | Raise a pre-seed/seed round before or shortly after quitting |\n| **D** | Negotiate leave of absence / part-time | Google's internal policies sometimes permit 3\u20136 month leaves or 60% time |\n| **E** | Moonlight seriously for 6 months, then decide | Validate idea nights/weekends with a forcing-function deadline |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: Expected Net Worth Impact (\u0394 vs. staying, 5-year horizon)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Key Assumptions |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n| A (Stay) | $0 (baseline) | \u2014 | ~$350K/yr comp continues; RSU refreshes |\n| B (Bootstrap) | **\u2212$450K** | (\u2212$1.2M, +$2.5M) | Forgo ~$1.75M gross comp; startup has ~10% chance of meaningful exit ($5M+ founder return) |\n| C (Quit + raise) | **\u2212$250K** | (\u2212$900K, +$4M) | Dilution but less cash burn; higher variance upside if funded well |\n| D (Leave/part-time) | **\u2212$80K** | (\u2212$200K, +$500K) | Reduced comp ~40% for 1 year; limited startup progress |\n| E (Moonlight then decide) | **\u2212$50K** | (\u2212$300K, +$1.5M) | 6 months opportunity cost is low; information gain is high |\n\n*Calculation sketch for B:* Forgone pre-tax comp \u2248 5 \u00d7 $350K = $1.75M. Burn $150K of savings on startup. P(exit \u2265 $5M to founder) \u2248 8\u201312%. E[startup outcome] \u2248 0.10 \u00d7 $5M + 0.05 \u00d7 $1M + 0.85 \u00d7 $0 = $550K. Net \u0394 \u2248 $550K \u2212 $1.75M + resumed salary from Year 3 if fail \u2248 **\u2212$450K** in expectation.\n\n### KPI 2: Career Optionality Score (Index: Current = 100)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A | 100 | (95, 110) |\n| B | 85 | (60, 120) |\n| C | 90 | (65, 125) |\n| D | 97 | (90, 105) |\n| E | 98 | (90, 110) |\n\n*Note:* Founder experience at your level is generally resume-positive even if the startup fails, but a 2-year gap at age ~35 does slightly reduce leverage for returning to a senior IC/PM role at FAANG tier. Successful fundraising (C) signals market validation that protects optionality.\n\n### KPI 3: Life Satisfaction Index (1\u201310 at Year 2)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| A | 6.0 | (5, 7) |\n| B | 6.5 | (3, 9) |\n| C | 7.0 | (4, 9) |\n| D | 6.5 | (5, 8) |\n| E | 6.8 | (5, 8) |\n\n*Variance is the story.* B and C have enormous spread \u2014 the lows (startup failing, savings depleted, marital stress with a toddler) are **very low**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Statistic | Source / Estimate |\n|-----------|-------------------|\n| Startup failure rate (seed-stage) | **~90% fail to return invested capital** (CB Insights, Carta data) |\n| DevTools startups specifically | Crowded category; ~60 funded in 2023 alone; median outcome is acqui-hire or shutdown. Notable successes (Vercel, Supabase) are survivorship-biased. |\n| Founder median earnings Years 1\u20133 | **$0\u2013$80K/yr** (First Round State of Startups survey) |\n| FAANG PM returning after startup | ~70\u201380% land equivalent-level role within 6 months if startup was <3 years (anecdotal LinkedIn data, Blind surveys) |\n| Regret rate for *not* attempting | Psychologists (Gilovich & Medvec) find **omission regrets dominate commission regrets** over long horizons \u2014 people regret not trying more than trying and failing |\n| Divorce risk with income shock + toddler | Financial stress is the #1 cited factor; ~8\u201312% base divorce rate per 5-year window rises with income volatility |\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cognitive Biases Detected in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Passion bias / affect heuristic** | \"I'm passionate about\" is doing heavy emotional lifting; passion \u2260 product-market fit |\n| **Binary framing** | You asked \"should I quit\" \u2014 a false dichotomy that hides options D and E |\n| **Sunk cost of ideation** | The more time you've spent thinking about this idea, the more committed you feel, independent of its quality |\n| **Denominator neglect** | You focus on \"I have $200K saved\" (feels like a lot) without framing it against $350K/yr burn rate \u2014 it's ~7 months of lifestyle replacement |\n| **Survivorship bias** | The dev tools founders you admire are visible; the hundreds who failed are not |\n| **Omission of spouse's risk preference** | The framing is \"I\" \u2014 but this is a household decision with asymmetric downside for your partner |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendation\n\n### **Do Option E first \u2192 then conditionally move to C.**\n\n**Phase 1 (Months 0\u20136): Moonlight with intent.**\n- Set **three falsifiable milestones**: (1) Talk to 40+ target users, (2) Build an MVP that 5+ teams use weekly, (3) Get at least 1 LOI or letter of intent to pay.\n- If you hit 2/3: proceed. If 0\u20131: shelve it.\n- This costs you ~$50K in reduced side-project time and some sleep \u2014 trivial compared to $1.75M in forgone comp.\n\n**Phase 2 (Months 6\u20139): Raise, then quit.**\n- Seek $1\u20132M pre-seed. Investor interest is itself a powerful signal of idea quality.\n- Having external capital means you **don't burn your $200K savings** \u2014 which is your family's safety net, not your startup fund.\n- Negotiate your Google exit for a clean vest date.\n\n**Why not B (bootstrap immediately)?**\n- Expected value is the worst of all non-status-quo options.\n- The confidence interval's downside (\u2212$1.2M) interacts catastrophically with having a 2-year-old and a household that's optimized around dual high income.\n- You **can recover passion; you cannot easily recover a depleted emergency fund during a toddler's critical years.**\n\n**The meta-principle:** Maximize information before maximizing commitment. Six months of disciplined validation converts this from a *passion bet* into an *informed bet* \u2014 and informed bets have dramatically better base rates.\n\n---\n\n> **Bottom line in one sentence:** Don't quit Monday \u2014 validate brutally for 6 months, then raise money, *then* quit, so you're risking investors' capital on a de-risked idea instead of your toddler's college fund on a passion project.",
