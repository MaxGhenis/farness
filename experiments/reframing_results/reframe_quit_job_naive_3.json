  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your Startup Decision\n\nThis is a genuinely hard decision, and I want to be honest with you rather than just cheerleading.\n\n## What I'd actually recommend\n\n**Don't quit yet. But take serious, time-bound steps to test whether you should.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n## The real math\n\n- You're giving up **$350K/year** \u2014 that's not just salary, it's Google equity vesting, healthcare, and 401k matching\n- $200K in savings sounds like a lot, but with a family in a HCOL area (likely, given Google PM comp), that's roughly **8-12 months of runway** if your spouse's income covers basics\n- Developer tools is a real market, but it's also **crowded and notoriously hard to monetize** \u2014 you'd be competing for attention from people who expect things to be free/open-source\n\n## What concerns me about quitting now\n\n- You said \"idea\" \u2014 not \"I have 10 paying design partners\" or \"I've built a prototype with traction.\" Passion for an idea is the weakest signal.\n- A 2-year-old means your spouse becomes a single parent operationally while also being the sole financial safety net. That's a **relationship stress test** people consistently underestimate.\n- Google PM experience is valuable for fundraising, but investors will ask what you've validated, not where you worked.\n\n## What I'd do instead (a 3-6 month honest test)\n\n1. **Talk to 30+ potential users** in the next 6 weeks. Not friends. Real developers. Do they have the problem you think they have? Will they pay?\n2. **Build a rough prototype** on nights/weekends or take a leave of absence if Google offers one. Yes, this is hard with a toddler. That difficulty is informative.\n3. **Get specific about the business model.** \"Developer tools\" ranges from billion-dollar outcomes to lifestyle businesses to money pits. Which is yours?\n4. **Set a clear quit threshold.** Something like: \"If I get X letters of intent / Y waitlist signups / Z early customers, I quit. If not, I don't.\"\n5. **Have the real conversation with your spouse** \u2014 not \"would you support me?\" (they'll say yes out of love) but \"here's specifically what this costs us financially and practically, what's your honest comfort level?\"\n\n## When quitting would make sense\n\n- You've validated demand with real evidence, not just enthusiasm\n- You have a co-founder (solo technical founder doing dev tools is a hard path for a PM)\n- You and your spouse have explicitly agreed on a financial runway and a \"stop\" point\n- You've explored whether a leave of absence or reduced schedule is possible first\n\n## The honest uncomfortable part\n\nMost startup ideas feel urgent. They almost never actually are. If this is a genuinely good opportunity, it will survive 3-6 months of rigorous validation. **If it can't survive that, it wouldn't have survived your savings running out either.**\n\nThe people who tell you to \"just leap\" are usually people who don't have a 2-year-old depending on them.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Your situation is strong enough to make this possible, but you haven't described enough validation to make it *wise* yet. Do the work to turn conviction into evidence, then make the leap with confidence rather than hope.\n\nWhat specifically is the developer tools idea? I might be able to pressure-test it further.",
