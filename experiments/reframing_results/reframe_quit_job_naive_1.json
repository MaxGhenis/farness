  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your Startup Decision\n\nThis is a high-stakes decision, so I want to be genuinely helpful rather than just cheerleading or fear-mongering. Let me work through this honestly.\n\n## What I'd actually recommend\n\n**Don't quit yet. But set a concrete timeline to earn the right to quit.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n## The real math\n\n- $350K/year = ~$29K/month gross, probably ~$18-20K net\n- $200K savings sounds like a lot, but with a family in a GOOG-cost-of-living area, that's maybe **10-12 months of runway** if you're disciplined\n- That's not runway for a startup. That's runway for *your life while you attempt a startup that also needs funding or revenue*\n- Your spouse's income helps, but becoming suddenly dependent on one income with a toddler creates relationship pressure that people chronically underestimate\n\n## What people get wrong about this decision\n\n**\"Passion\" is necessary but not sufficient.** The relevant questions are:\n\n- Have you talked to 30+ developers who would pay for this? Not \"would you use this?\" but \"would you pay $X/month?\"\n- Do you have a co-founder, or are you going solo? Solo developer tools companies are particularly hard\n- Is there a reason this *can't* be validated before quitting? If so, what is it specifically?\n- Do you have unique insight from your Google role that gives you an edge, or is this an idea you could have had anywhere?\n\n## The honest uncomfortable parts\n\n- **Google PM to founder is a bigger identity shift than people expect.** You go from resources, brand, and leverage to having nothing. Many ex-FAANG founders struggle with this more than they anticipate.\n- **A 2-year-old becomes a 3-year-old fast.** This isn't an argument against starting up \u2014 it's an argument against doing it recklessly. The \"I'll just work 80 hours\" plan has a real cost here.\n- **$200K feels like freedom but acts like a countdown clock.** Countdown clocks make you desperate, and desperate founders make bad decisions.\n\n## What I'd actually do in your position\n\n**Months 1-3 (now, while employed):**\n- Validate aggressively on nights/weekends. Yes, it's hard. That difficulty is itself a useful filter.\n- Talk to 30-50 target users. Get 5+ to say \"I will pay for this when it exists\"\n- Build a rough prototype or detailed demo\n- Find a co-founder if you don't have one\n\n**Month 4: Decision gate**\n- If you have real signal (LOIs, waitlist with engagement, a co-founder, or early revenue), quit\n- If you have lukewarm signal, give it 2 more months\n- If you have nothing, seriously reconsider whether this is the right idea (not whether you're the right person \u2014 the right *idea*)\n\n**If/when you quit:**\n- Have 18 months of family expenses secured (savings + spouse income), not 10\n- Consider whether you should raise a small pre-seed first \u2014 your Google PM background makes this realistic\n- Set a clear \"return to employment\" tripwire so you're not boiling the frog on your savings\n\n## The bottom line\n\nThe worst version of this isn't \"you quit and the startup fails.\" That's recoverable \u2014 Google or similar would likely hire you back within a year.\n\n**The worst version is you quit prematurely, burn through savings without real validation, strain your marriage, and end up back in a PM job having learned mostly that you should have validated first.**\n\nThe best version is you validate while employed, quit with conviction and evidence, and give yourself a real shot.\n\nThe passion is a good sign. Channel it into *de-risking* rather than *leaping*, at least for the next 90 days. If the idea is as good as you think, it'll survive 90 days of validation. If it won't survive that, you've learned something important cheaply.\n\n---\n\n*What does your validation look like so far? That would change my advice significantly.*",
