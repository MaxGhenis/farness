  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis\n\nThis is a significant decision, so let me help you think through it rigorously rather than just give a quick answer.\n\n## The Financial Picture\n\n**Direct costs:**\n- Tuition: ~$160K\n- Opportunity cost (2 years of salary): ~$260K\n- **Total real cost: ~$420K+** (plus living expenses)\n\n**To break even financially**, you'd need to earn significantly more post-MBA, sustained over many years. The math is often less favorable than people assume, especially since your current salary already has solid growth trajectory in tech.\n\n## The Harder Questions I'd Push You On\n\n**What specifically do you want the MBA *for*?**\n- **Career switch** (consulting, finance, product management, VC)? \u2192 Strongest case for going\n- **Faster advancement in tech?** \u2192 Weaker case. Engineering leadership values engineering depth. An MBA is rarely the fastest path.\n- **\"It seems like a good thing to have\"?** \u2192 Not worth $420K+\n- **Network and credentials?** \u2192 Valid, but be honest about whether you'll leverage them\n\n**Which program?** \"Good\" matters a lot here.\n- Top ~7 (HBS, Stanford, Wharton, etc.): The network and brand genuinely open doors that are otherwise closed\n- Top 15-25: Still valuable but the ROI math gets much tighter\n- Below that: Very hard to justify financially\n\n## What I'd Actually Recommend\n\n**Don't go *yet* \u2014 unless you have clear conviction on the \"why.\"**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n1. **You're early in your career.** Most MBA candidates with the strongest outcomes go at 4-6 years of experience. You'll get more from the program and recruit better with another 1-2 years of seniority.\n\n2. **Tech compensation grows steeply.** In 2-3 years you could be at $170-250K+. That makes the opportunity cost even higher, BUT it also means you'll have more savings and clearer career vision.\n\n3. **The deferral test:** Many top programs allow 1-2 year deferrals. If yours does, that's a low-risk move. If the idea of deferring fills you with relief rather than disappointment, that tells you something.\n\n4. **If you have a burning, specific goal** \u2014 like breaking into PE, strategy consulting, or a career that genuinely gates on MBA credentials \u2014 then the calculus changes and it may well be worth it.\n\n## My Bottom Line\n\nThe MBA is a **powerful tool for career pivots and specific ambitions**, but a **poor general-purpose investment** for software engineers who are already on a strong trajectory.\n\nGo if you know what door you want it to open. Don't go just because the door exists.\n\nWhat's driving your interest? I can give sharper advice if I know your actual goal.",
