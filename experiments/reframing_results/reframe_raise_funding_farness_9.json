The median reversion point is 6-9 months. *(Source: a16z growth benchmarks, Lenny Rachitsky dataset)*\n\n- **VC market availability in 6-9 months:** ~30-40% of companies that *plan* to raise \"later at a better valuation\" end up raising at a **lower** valuation or on worse terms, or fail to raise at all. *(Source: Carta data on down rounds and bridge frequency)*\n\n- **Startups that die with \"good metrics\":** ~25% of startup deaths occur in companies that had strong growth but ran out of cash while optimizing for valuation. *(CB Insights post-mortems)*\n\n- **Current fundraising environment:** Median time-to-close for Series B+ rounds in 2023-2024 is **4-6 months**, eating deeply into a 12-month runway if you wait.\n\n- **$500K MRR \u2192 $200M valuation = 33x ARR multiple.** This is at or above the 75th percentile for current SaaS valuations. Waiting assumes the multiple *holds or expands* \u2014 against a backdrop of multiple compression industry-wide.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears | Impact |\n|------|---------------|--------|\n| **Anchoring on valuation** | The question frames this as \"better valuation later\" as though valuation is the primary variable. It's not. *Survival-weighted expected value* is. | Massively distorts the decision |\n| **Optimism bias / Planning fallacy** | \"15% MoM\" is implicitly projected forward as though it will continue. Base rates say it almost certainly won't at that rate. | Inflates the \"wait\" option by ~2-3x |\n| **Denominator neglect** | Founders fixate on dilution percentage (10%) without weighting it by the probability of reaching the outcome where that dilution matters. 10% of a live company >> 0% of a dead one. | Makes Option A feel more costly than it is |\n| **Narrow framing** | The question presents a binary (raise now vs. wait). The bridge option (C) and profitability option (D) aren't considered. | Eliminates potentially superior hybrid strategies |\n| **Endowment effect** | \"My equity is worth $X, and I don't want to give it away.\" You don't have $200M. You have a *probability distribution* over outcomes. | Overvalues current ownership stake |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Expected Value Calculation & Recommendation\n\n### Simplified EV Comparison\n\n$$EV = P(\\text{survival}) \\times E[\\text{founder value} | \\text{survive}] + P(\\text{death}) \\times 0$$\n\n| Option | P(survive) | E[value if survive] | **Expected Value** |\n|--------|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| A: Raise now | 0.95 | $158M | **$150M** |\n| B: Wait | 0.70 | $200M | **$140M** |\n| C: Bridge | 0.85 | $182M | **$155M** |\n| D: Profitability | 0.60 | $133M | **$80M** |\n\n### Variance-Adjusted View\n\nOption B has the highest *maximum* outcome but also a **30% probability of zero.** For a founder (whose wealth is concentrated in this single asset), this is not a symmetric bet. Risk-of-ruin considerations further favor A or C.\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n### **Raise the $20M now. Close within 60 days. Stop optimizing for valuation.**\n\n**The core logic:**\n\n1. **Your 33x ARR multiple is already generous.** You are not leaving money on the table \u2014 you're being offered a historically strong valuation. Waiting assumes multiple expansion in an environment of compression.\n\n2. **Growth will almost certainly decelerate.** The base rate for sustained 15% MoM is brutal. If you slip to 8-10% MoM (still excellent), the \"better valuation\" evaporates and you're now raising from a position of *declining trajectory* \u2014 the single worst negotiating position in venture.\n\n3. **The survival probability delta is enormous.** Going from 95% to 70% survival for a *marginal* increase in expected valuation is a terrible trade on any rational framework.\n\n4. **Runway is freedom.** 36 months of runway lets you make strategic hires, survive market shocks, and negotiate your Series C from strength.\n\n**The only exception:** If you have **high confidence** (not hope \u2014 evidence) that a specific, imminent milestone (major enterprise contract, regulatory approval, etc.) would step-function your valuation in the next 3-4 months, Option C (small bridge) becomes attractive. But \"more months of the same growth\" is not that milestone.\n\n> **Bottom line:** The dilution you're trying to avoid is ~2-3% (the difference between raising now vs. a theoretical higher valuation). The risk you're taking to avoid it is a ~25-30% increase in company death probability. That is not a trade any rational decision-maker should take.",
