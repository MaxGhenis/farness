  "response_text": "# Thinking Through Your Startup Decision\n\nThis is a genuinely hard decision, and I want to be honest with you rather than just cheerleading or just being cautious.\n\n## My honest take: **Not yet \u2014 but possibly soon, with conditions.**\n\nHere's my reasoning:\n\n---\n\n## What's real about your situation\n\n**Financial reality check:**\n- You're walking away from ~$350K/year with a 2-year-old\n- $200K in savings sounds like a lot but is roughly **6-8 months of Bay Area family expenses** if you're not dramatically cutting lifestyle\n- That's not runway for a startup \u2014 that's runway for *you*, and they're not the same thing\n- Your spouse's income helps, but becoming a single-income family with a toddler creates real pressure that affects decision-making quality\n\n**What I don't know but you should:**\n- Does your spouse genuinely support this, including the realistic downside?\n- How long could you actually sustain on one income + savings?\n- Have you validated this idea *at all* beyond your own conviction?\n\n---\n\n## Why \"passion\" isn't enough to justify quitting now\n\nLots of smart PMs at Google have startup ideas they're passionate about. Passion is necessary but tells you almost nothing about whether the business will work. Developer tools is also a **crowded, hard-to-monetize space** where many well-funded companies struggle.\n\nQuestions you should be able to answer before quitting:\n\n- Have you talked to 30+ target developers about this problem?\n- Would any of them pay for a solution today?\n- Do you have a co-founder, or are you going solo?\n- What's your unfair advantage beyond \"I work at Google\"?\n- Can you build an MVP yourself, or do you need to hire?\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually recommend\n\n**Phase 1 \u2014 Validate ruthlessly while employed (2-4 months)**\n- Do customer discovery on nights/weekends\n- Build a rough prototype or landing page\n- Get letters of intent or waitlist signups\n- Find a co-founder if you don't have one\n- This is not \"playing it safe\" \u2014 this is doing the work that most founders skip and then regret\n\n**Phase 2 \u2014 Set a clear decision gate**\n- Define specific evidence that would justify quitting: X interested users, a co-founder committed, a clear product spec, maybe even early revenue\n- Also define what would tell you to shelve the idea\n- Having criteria *in advance* protects you from both fear and overconfidence\n\n**Phase 3 \u2014 If you hit your gates, then quit with a real plan**\n- Have 12+ months of family runway secured (savings + spouse income)\n- Have your spouse explicitly on board with a timeline (\"I'm giving this 18 months\")\n- Have a specific plan for what you're building in the first 90 days\n\n---\n\n## The uncomfortable truth\n\nThe biggest risk isn't quitting Google. It's quitting Google **before you've done the cheap, fast work that tells you whether this idea has legs.** If you can't find strong signal while employed, quitting won't create that signal \u2014 it'll just add financial pressure.\n\nIf you *do* find signal, quitting becomes much easier to justify \u2014 to yourself, your spouse, and eventually to investors.\n\n---\n\n**The one exception:** If you genuinely believe the window is closing \u2014 a competitor is building this now, or some market timing issue is real \u2014 then speed matters more and the calculus changes. But be honest about whether that's true or whether it's urgency manufactured by excitement.\n\nWhat stage are you actually at with validation?",
