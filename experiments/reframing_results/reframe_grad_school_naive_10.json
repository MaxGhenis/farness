  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis\n\nThis is a significant decision, so let me walk through it honestly \u2014 including the parts that are uncomfortable.\n\n## The Real Cost\n\nLet's be clear-eyed about the total investment:\n\n- **Tuition:** ~$160K\n- **Lost wages:** ~$260K (2 years of salary)\n- **Lost retirement compounding:** meaningful but hard to quantify\n- **Total opportunity cost: ~$420K+**\n\nThat's the hole you need to climb out of.\n\n## The Case FOR Going\n\n- **Career pivot potential** \u2014 if you want to move into product management, strategy, consulting, VC, or leadership at a non-tech company, an MBA is a real door-opener\n- **Network** \u2014 this is genuinely valuable and hard to replicate, especially from a top program\n- **Salary ceiling** \u2014 MBA grads from top programs often land $150-200K+ starting (with signing bonuses), and the long-term trajectory into executive roles can be steeper\n- **You're young enough** \u2014 3 years of experience is a reasonable time to go; waiting longer increases the opportunity cost\n\n## The Case AGAINST\n\n- **You're already in one of the highest-paying fields without needing an MBA**\n- Senior engineers and staff engineers at strong companies make $200-400K+ without business school\n- **Tech companies mostly don't care about MBAs** for engineering roles\n- **$130K at 3 years suggests a solid trajectory** \u2014 in 2 years you could be at $170-200K with no debt\n- The ROI math for software engineers is worse than almost any other profession entering an MBA\n\n## The Critical Question\n\n**What do you actually want to do with your career?**\n\n- **\"I want to keep building software but earn more\"** \u2192 Don't go. Level up as an engineer. The MBA won't help much.\n- **\"I want to move into product, consulting, or business strategy\"** \u2192 Reasonable case to go.\n- **\"I want to start a company\"** \u2192 Mixed. Network helps, but $160K+ in tuition could literally fund your startup.\n- **\"I'm bored and this feels like progress\"** \u2192 Don't go. This is the most expensive way to figure yourself out.\n\n## My Honest Recommendation\n\n**Probably don't go \u2014 unless you have a clear career goal that specifically requires an MBA.**\n\nFor software engineers, the MBA is often a lateral move financially disguised as an upgrade. You're leaving a field where experience IS the credential to enter a field where you're starting over with a credential.\n\nThe exception: if you've genuinely decided you don't want to be an engineer anymore and you want a career that uses business school as a launching pad, then it can absolutely be worth it.\n\n**What's driving your interest in the MBA?** That answer matters more than any spreadsheet.",
