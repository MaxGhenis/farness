  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis: Farness Framework\n\n## Step 1: Define Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **KPI 1: Net Present Value of Lifetime Earnings** | NPV of post-decision earnings minus costs, discounted at 5% | 20 years |\n| **KPI 2: Career Optionality Score** | Number of meaningfully distinct career paths accessible (roles, industries, functions) | 5 years post-decision |\n| **KPI 3: Downside Risk** | Probability of being financially worse off than the status quo trajectory | 5 years post-decision |\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Identify Options\n\n| # | Option | Description |\n|---|--------|-------------|\n| **A** | Full-time MBA now | 2 years, ~$160K tuition + ~$260K opportunity cost |\n| **B** | Stay on current SWE path | Continue engineering, pursue promotions |\n| **C** | Part-time / Executive MBA | Keep earning while studying (many top programs offer this) |\n| **D** | Targeted skill-building without MBA | Leadership courses, transition to PM/management internally, strategic networking |\n| **E** | Defer 2-3 years | Build more experience, clearer goals, potentially employer-sponsored |\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Point Estimates & 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: 20-Year NPV of Incremental Earnings (vs. doing nothing baseline of $0)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Key Assumptions |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------------|\n| **A: Full-time MBA** | +$200K | (\u2212$300K to +$900K) | Post-MBA comp ~$170-190K starting; wide variance by exit (consulting/finance vs. tech PM vs. return to SWE) |\n| **B: Stay SWE** | $0 (baseline) | (\u2212$200K to +$400K) | Senior SWE in 2-3 yrs \u2192 $180-220K; Staff in 5-7 yrs \u2192 $250-350K at top firms |\n| **C: Part-time MBA** | +$150K | (\u2212$100K to +$500K) | Lower brand premium, but no opportunity cost; tuition may be lower |\n| **D: No MBA, skill-build** | +$50K | (\u2212$100K to +$300K) | Transition to EM/PM internally; lower ceiling but lower cost |\n| **E: Defer 2-3 years** | +$300K | (\u2212$200K to +$1M) | Higher pre-MBA comp \u2192 higher opportunity cost, but better recruiting outcomes, possible sponsorship |\n\n### KPI 2: Career Optionality (distinct accessible paths, 1-10 scale)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A: Full-time MBA** | 8 | (6 to 9) |\n| **B: Stay SWE** | 4 | (3 to 6) |\n| **C: Part-time MBA** | 6 | (4 to 7) |\n| **D: No MBA, skill-build** | 5 | (3 to 6) |\n| **E: Defer** | 8 | (6 to 9) |\n\n### KPI 3: Probability of Being Financially Worse Off at Year 5\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A: Full-time MBA** | 35% | (20% to 50%) |\n| **B: Stay SWE** | 10% | (5% to 20%) |\n| **C: Part-time MBA** | 15% | (8% to 25%) |\n| **D: No MBA, skill-build** | 12% | (5% to 20%) |\n| **E: Defer** | 25% | (15% to 40%) |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **True all-in cost of a top MBA:** ~$420-500K when including tuition ($160K) + foregone salary ($260K) + foregone investment returns + living expenses. This is frequently underestimated.\n- **Median post-MBA salary (top 15 program):** ~$155-175K base + $30-50K signing bonus (GSB/HBS/Wharton data, 2023).\n- **SWE at 3 YoE current trajectory:** Senior SWE at FAANG-tier in 2-3 years \u2192 $250-350K+ total comp. Staff in 5-7 years \u2192 $400-500K+. **This is the critical base rate most MBA analyses ignore for tech workers.**\n- **MBA earnings premium literature:** Broadly ~$15-20K/year over career, but studies typically compare against *average* bachelor's holders, not against software engineers specifically. For SWEs, the premium is substantially smaller or potentially **negative**.\n- **Career switching rate:** ~40-50% of MBA grads switch industries; the degree is most valuable for *career changers*.\n- **Regret rates:** ~10-20% of MBA grads from top programs report the degree wasn't worth the cost (Poets & Quants surveys).\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring on tuition only** | The question says \"$80K/year\" \u2014 but the real cost is **$420K+** including opportunity cost. Framing on tuition alone makes it feel 2.5\u00d7 cheaper than it is. |\n| **Prestige bias / Social proof** | \"Good MBA program\" triggers status-seeking heuristics. The value of the credential is real but often over-weighted relative to the alternative of compounding in a high-paying field. |\n| **Neglect of the counterfactual** | The framing is \"should I go?\" \u2014 not \"what would I do with 2 years and $420K otherwise?\" A SWE investing $420K and spending 2 years reaching Staff level may dominate. |\n| **Action bias** | Going to MBA feels like \"doing something.\" Staying feels passive. But staying and executing a deliberate growth plan is also an active choice. |\n| **Narrative bias** | MBA programs sell a compelling transformation story. The less cinematic path of steady engineering promotion is psychologically under-weighted. |\n| **Underweighting of tech compensation trajectory** | Most MBA ROI calculators assume linear salary growth from $130K. SWE comp is highly non-linear (jumps at Senior/Staff levels). |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### The critical question is: **What do you want the MBA *for*?**\n\n**If you want to stay in tech** (PM, engineering leadership, or startup):\n> **Don't go now. Option D or E dominates.** The NPV is likely negative. Your SWE trajectory to $300K+ in 3 years almost certainly outperforms post-MBA tech PM/EM comp, and you'll have $420K more in capital. An MBA adds marginal value in tech \u2014 experience and internal transitions are the standard path.\n\n**If you want to switch to consulting, finance, or a non-tech industry:**\n> **Option A becomes defensible, but Option E is probably better.** With only 3 YoE, your pre-MBA profile is thin for top recruiting outcomes. Two more years \u2192 stronger story, higher pre-MBA comp (raising your negotiating anchor), and possibly employer sponsorship.\n\n**If you're unsure what you want:**\n> **This is the strongest signal not to go yet.** An MBA is a $420K+ instrument that depreciates if not deployed strategically. Spend 6-12 months doing informational interviews across target careers before committing.\n\n### Bottom Line Expected Value Ranking:\n\n| Rank | Option | Conditions |\n|------|--------|------------|\n| 1 | **E: Defer 2-3 years** | Best EV if career switch is the goal |\n| 2 | **D: Skill-build, no MBA** | Best EV if staying in tech |\n| 3 | **C: Part-time MBA** | Reasonable hedge if optionality is paramount |\n| 4 | **A: Full-time MBA now** | Only optimal if you have a *specific* non-tech exit target and time-sensitive reasons |\n| 5 | **B: Pure status quo** | Dominated by D in all scenarios |\n\n**My recommendation: Do not enroll this year.** The expected value is maximized by either (a) executing a deliberate tech-track growth plan, or (b) deferring until you have a specific career goal the MBA uniquely enables, more experience to recruit from a position of strength, and ideally employer sponsorship to cut the cost in half.",
