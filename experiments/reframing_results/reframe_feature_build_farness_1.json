Most B2B work is still desktop-centric.\n- **\"Customers asking\" \u2260 customers paying**: Product management research consistently shows that stated preference overpredicts actual usage by 3-5x. The ~10-15 vocal customers likely represent a small fraction of real demand.\n- **B2B SaaS with 200 customers**: Median ACV is likely $15-50K. At 200 customers and ~$5M ARR, $360K all-in is **7% of annual revenue** \u2014 a significant bet.\n- **PWA adoption in B2B**: Companies like Starbucks, Pinterest, and Trivago saw 50-80% of native app engagement from PWAs at a fraction of cost. In B2B, where \"app store presence\" matters less, PWAs often capture the majority of value.\n- **Feature-driven churn prevention**: Research from ProfitWell suggests individual features rarely move churn by more than 1-3 percentage points.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears Here |\n|------|-------------------|\n| **Anchoring** | The question is framed as \"native app: yes/no\" with a specific $200K figure, anchoring you to the most expensive option and a binary choice |\n| **Availability bias** | \"Users have been asking\" \u2014 vocal minority creates an outsized perception of demand. You remember the requests; you don't remember the 185 customers who never mentioned it |\n| **IKEA effect / Commitment escalation** | Once you build a native app, you'll feel compelled to invest more to justify the sunk cost, even if adoption disappoints |\n| **Neglect of alternatives** | The framing omits PWA, responsive redesign, and hybrid \u2014 three options that may dominate on expected value |\n| **Feature bias** | Building something new feels more productive than optimizing what exists. A well-optimized responsive web app may solve the actual problem |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### **Recommended: Option B \u2014 Progressive Web App (PWA)**\n\n**Expected value analysis:**\n\n| Option | E[24-mo Net Benefit] | Downside Risk | Reversibility |\n|--------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|\n| A \u2014 Native | ~-$36K | Lose $300K+ | Low (ongoing maintenance trap) |\n| **B \u2014 PWA** | **~$140K** | **Lose $30K worst case** | **High (low maintenance, easy to abandon)** |\n| C \u2014 Responsive | ~$40K | Near zero downside | High |\n| D \u2014 Hybrid | ~$47K | Lose $150K+ | Medium |\n\n### Action plan:\n\n1. **Immediately** (Week 1-2): Survey all 200 customers on mobile usage \u2014 actual frequency, use cases, devices. Get data, not anecdotes.\n2. **Short-term** (Weeks 3-8): Build a PWA. Add offline capability, push notifications, home screen installation. Cost: ~$40K.\n3. **Measure** (Months 3-6): Track mobile session frequency, task completion rates, NPS delta for mobile users.\n4. **Gate decision**: Only invest in native/hybrid IF PWA mobile engagement exceeds 30% WAU AND you can identify \u2265$300K in pipeline blocked specifically by lack of app store presence.\n\n### Why not the native app now:\n\nAt 200 customers, **you are almost certainly not at the scale where a native app's marginal benefit over a PWA justifies 5-7x the cost**. The $200K + ongoing maintenance would be better deployed on features that drive expansion revenue across your entire customer base. If mobile truly becomes a competitive battleground, the PWA gives you real usage data to justify and properly scope a native investment later.\n\n**The best decision isn't \"build or don't build.\" It's \"buy the cheapest valid information before making an irreversible bet.\"**",
