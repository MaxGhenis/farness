  "response_text": "# My Honest Recommendation: Raise Now, But Thoughtfully\n\n## The Short Answer\n\n**Raise now.** But not primarily for the reason you think, and not without some important caveats.\n\n## Let me walk through the real reasoning:\n\n### The math on waiting looks tempting but is misleading\n\nAt 15% MoM growth, in 6 months you'd be at ~$1.15M MRR. In theory, that commands a higher valuation. This is the case for waiting.\n\n**But here's what that analysis misses:**\n\n- **15% MoM growth rarely sustains for 6+ more months.** It just doesn't. If growth slows to 8-10% while you're \"waiting for a better valuation,\" you've weakened your position, not strengthened it.\n- **12 months of runway with no raise means you hit the danger zone (~6 months) in 6 months.** VCs smell desperation at 6 months of runway. You'd be fundraising from a position of weakness exactly when you need strength.\n- **Market windows close.** VC interest is high *right now*. Interest rates, fund cycles, competitive dynamics, macro sentiment - any of these can shift.\n\n### The real risks of waiting\n\n- A single bad quarter changes the entire narrative\n- A competitor raises and the space gets \"crowded\"\n- The fundraising environment shifts (this happens faster than founders expect)\n- You make compromises on hiring/growth to preserve runway that end up costing more than dilution would have\n\n### The real risks of raising now\n\n- ~10% dilution you could theoretically avoid\n- Potential distraction (2-3 months of founder time)\n- Board/governance complexity\n\n**That dilution trade-off is not close.** You're trading ~10% dilution for existential risk reduction and the ability to invest aggressively during your highest-growth phase.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually push back on\n\n**The framing of your question concerns me a little.** \"Wait until we're bigger for a better valuation\" is optimizing for ownership percentage. The better question is: *what maximizes the value of the equity I keep?*\n\n$20M at $200M (40x forward ARR) is a strong deal at $6M ARR. That's not a desperate valuation - that's a market-rate or better valuation. Holding out for $250M or $300M is optimizing for a variable that matters far less than:\n\n- Ability to hire aggressively right now\n- Ability to survive a growth slowdown\n- Ability to move fast against competitors\n- Your own stress level and decision-making quality\n\n---\n\n## My specific advice\n\n1. **Raise now, but run a tight process** (3-4 weeks, create competitive tension)\n2. **Don't take the first term sheet** - if VCs are interested, get multiple offers\n3. **Negotiate on terms that matter more than valuation** - pro-rata rights, board composition, protective provisions matter more than $200M vs $220M\n4. **Raise $15-20M, not more** - don't over-dilute just because you can. Take what lets you get to a clear Series B milestone\n5. **Set a clear plan for the capital** - \"18-24 months to $X MRR\" so the money accelerates growth rather than extending comfort\n\n---\n\n## The one scenario where I'd wait\n\nIf you're **3-4 months away** from a major inflection point (huge enterprise contract signing, key product launch, regulatory approval) that would fundamentally change the narrative - not just incrementally higher MRR - then a short delay could be justified. But even then, I'd probably start the process now and time the close.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Founders who optimize for valuation often underperform founders who optimize for having the resources to win. You have a strong hand right now. Play it.",
