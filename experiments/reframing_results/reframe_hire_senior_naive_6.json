Let me walk through how I'd actually think about this.\n\n## First, diagnose the real problem\n\n\"We can't ship fast enough\" has multiple possible causes, and a VP of Engineering only solves some of them. Be honest about which of these is true:\n\n**A VP of Eng likely helps if:**\n- Your CTO is spending 60%+ of their time on people management, process, hiring, and project tracking\n- Engineers are good but poorly coordinated \u2014 unclear priorities, too much WIP, blocked work\n- Your CTO has genuine architecture/technical vision skills that are going to waste\n\n**A VP of Eng likely does NOT help if:**\n- The real issue is product direction keeps changing (that's a product/founder problem)\n- You have underperformers on the team that nobody is willing to address\n- Your CTO is actually struggling technically and \"architecture focus\" is a face-saving narrative\n- You simply don't have enough engineers yet and need to hire ICs first\n\n**Be brutally honest with yourself about which scenario you're in.**\n\n## If the diagnosis fits, here's what I'd actually recommend\n\n### Hire, but understand the risks\n\n**The case for:**\n- At 15 people post-Series A, this is roughly the right inflection point\n- CTO-to-VP-Eng splitting is a well-understood playbook that works when done right\n- The cost of your CTO being a bottleneck compounds every week\n\n**The real risks nobody tells you about:**\n\n1. **CTO/VP of Eng tension is almost guaranteed.** The boundaries between \"architecture\" and \"execution\" are blurry. You will have conflict over technical decisions. Define the split clearly *before* hiring, not after.\n\n2. **Your CTO may resist it emotionally** even if they intellectually agree. Losing direct reports feels like losing power. Have a candid conversation about this.\n\n3. **A bad VP of Eng at your stage is catastrophic.** A process-heavy leader from a 500-person company will suffocate your team. You need someone who's operated at the 15-to-50 person stage specifically.\n\n4. **It takes 3-6 months to see results.** Your shipping speed will likely get *worse* before it gets better during the transition.\n\n## What I'd do concretely\n\n**Before hiring:**\n- Have your CTO track their time for two weeks \u2014 literally log it. Confirm the management overhead hypothesis with data.\n- Ask your engineers (1-on-1, privately) what's actually slowing them down. The answer may surprise you.\n\n**If you proceed:**\n- Hire for the 15\u219250 stage, not the 200+ stage. Look for someone who's been a first VP of Eng before.\n- Have your CTO deeply involved in the hire, and make them co-own the success criteria.\n- Write down the CTO/VP Eng split *in a document* and share it with the team. Who owns technical decisions? Who owns process? Who owns hiring?\n- Set a 90-day check-in with clear expectations.\n\n**Consider the alternative:** Would a strong Engineering Manager (not VP-level) solve 80% of the problem at lower cost and lower risk? At 15 people, you might only need someone to run standups, unblock work, and own the hiring pipeline \u2014 not a full VP.\n\n## My honest bottom line\n\nThe instinct is probably right, but I'd give it a **30% chance you're solving the wrong problem**. Do the diagnostic work first \u2014 CTO time audit and honest engineer feedback. If those confirm the hypothesis, move fast on the hire but be extremely selective. The wrong VP of Eng will set you back six months, which at your stage is potentially fatal.\n\nThe single biggest mistake I'd warn against: **hiring this role to avoid a harder conversation** \u2014 whether that's with your CTO about their performance, with your team about accountability, or with yourselves about product-market fit.\n\nWhat does your CTO actually say when you ask them what's slowing the team down?",
