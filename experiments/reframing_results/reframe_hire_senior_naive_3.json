  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Probably yes, but slow down before you pull the trigger.\n\nThe instinct is right \u2014 splitting the CTO role into \"technical vision\" and \"engineering management\" is a well-established pattern that works. But I've seen this go wrong enough times that I want to push back on a few things before you commit.\n\n## First, make sure you're solving the right problem\n\n\"We can't ship fast enough\" has multiple possible causes, and a VP of Engineering only fixes some of them:\n\n**A VP Eng likely helps if:**\n- Your CTO is spending 60%+ of their time on people management, process, hiring, and project tracking\n- Engineers are blocked by unclear priorities, poor sprint hygiene, or lack of coordination\n- The CTO has strong architectural vision but visibly struggles with (or dislikes) management\n\n**A VP Eng probably won't help if:**\n- The real issue is technical debt or bad architectural decisions slowing everything down\n- You have the wrong engineers, not too few of them\n- Product/specs are constantly shifting and engineering is rebuilding things\n- The CTO is actually the bottleneck on technical decisions (reviewing every PR, etc.)\n\n**Be honest about which of these sounds more like your situation.** If it's the second category, a VP Eng will add overhead without fixing the root cause.\n\n## If you do move forward, here's what I'd think hard about\n\n### The CTO relationship is everything\nThis only works if your CTO genuinely wants it and doesn't experience it as a demotion. Have that conversation first \u2014 not \"we're thinking about this,\" but a real conversation about what they want their role to look like. Some CTOs will say yes but quietly resent it and undermine the VP Eng.\n\n### The reporting structure matters more than you think\n- **VP Eng reports to CEO, CTO is a peer:** Cleaner authority, but can create conflict\n- **VP Eng reports to CTO:** Preserves hierarchy, but the CTO is still a bottleneck if they micromanage\n\nThere's no universally right answer here, but decide deliberately.\n\n### At 15 people, this is a very senior hire for your stage\nA good VP Eng will cost $250-400k+ and will want to reshape your processes, possibly your team. That's appropriate \u2014 but make sure you're ready for that level of change. You should also ask: **could a strong Engineering Manager at $150-200k solve 80% of this problem at your current scale?** A VP Eng typically makes more sense at 25-40+ engineers.\n\n### Timing risk\nThis hire takes 3-5 months to find, 2-3 months to ramp. You won't feel relief for 6+ months. If your shipping problem is urgent, you need interim solutions too.\n\n## What I'd actually do in your shoes\n\n1. **This week:** Have a candid conversation with your CTO about what's actually consuming their time. Get specific \u2014 have them track a week if needed.\n2. **In parallel:** Consider whether a senior engineering manager or a strong tech lead promoted from within could take the management load off the CTO right now.\n3. **If the diagnosis confirms it's a management/process gap:** Start the VP Eng search, but hire a contract engineering manager or chief of staff to bridge the gap immediately.\n4. **Set clear success criteria** before you hire: what does \"shipping fast enough\" look like? If you can't define it, a new hire can't hit it.\n\n## The honest bottom line\n\nThe \"CTO focuses on architecture, VP Eng runs the team\" split is a proven model and you'll likely need it eventually. **My hesitation isn't about whether, it's about whether right now, at 15 people, this is the highest-leverage move** versus a less expensive intermediate step that buys you time to make this critical hire well rather than urgently.\n\nThe worst outcome is rushing this hire, getting a mediocre VP Eng, and spending 12 months discovering that while your shipping speed stays the same and you've now added politics to your problems.\n\n---\n\nWhat does your CTO actually say when you talk about what's slowing things down? That answer would change my recommendation significantly.",
