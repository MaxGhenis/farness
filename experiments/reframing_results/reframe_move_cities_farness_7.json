SF essentials run 40-50% higher. |\n| **B: Stay Austin** | $65K | ($55K \u2013 $75K) | $180K minus ~$42K taxes (no state income tax), ~$24K rent (avg $2,000/mo), ~$22K essentials. Texas tax advantage is real. |\n| **C: Remote for SF co.** | $80K | ($60K \u2013 $95K) | Likely $220-235K (SF companies discount 10-15% for remote). Austin COL. Best of both worlds. |\n| **D: Counteroffer Austin** | $72K | ($58K \u2013 $82K) | Realistic bump to $200-210K. Austin COL. |\n| **E: SF \"tour of duty\"** | $50K yr1 \u2192 $80K yr3 | ($35K \u2013 $95K) | Worse initially, better after relocation to lower-COL area with SF-caliber comp. High variance. |\n\n**Key finding: Option A actually *reduces* your discretionary income by ~$10K/yr.** This is consistent with most COL analyses.\n\n### KPI 2: 5-Year Career Expected Value (Year 5 TC)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| **A: Move to SF** | $370K | ($300K \u2013 $450K) | SF network effects, proximity to top-tier companies, faster comp escalation. Senior \u2192 Staff trajectory. |\n| **B: Stay Austin** | $250K | ($210K \u2013 $310K) | Austin tech scene growing but comp ceilings lower. Slower trajectory without forcing function. |\n| **C: Remote for SF co.** | $320K | ($260K \u2013 $390K) | Good company pedigree, but remote engineers are 15-20% less likely to be promoted (per Upwork/internal data from multiple FAANG companies). |\n| **D: Counteroffer Austin** | $260K | ($220K \u2013 $310K) | Counteroffers have a known failure mode (see base rates below). |\n| **E: SF tour of duty** | $350K | ($280K \u2013 $430K) | Captures SF trajectory benefits, then arbitrages to low-COL. |\n\n### KPI 3: Quality of Life (1-10)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Key Drivers |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-------------|\n| **A: Move to SF** | 5.5 | (4 \u2013 7) | Smaller housing, losing Austin social network, but cultural richness. Partner isolation risk. |\n| **B: Stay Austin** | 7.0 | (6 \u2013 8) | Established roots, lower stress, but potential career stagnation regret. |\n| **C: Remote for SF co.** | 7.5 | (6 \u2013 8.5) | Keep Austin life + better comp + stronger company. Risk: remote career ceiling. |\n| **D: Counteroffer Austin** | 6.5 | (5.5 \u2013 7.5) | Short-term boost, but employer trust erosion. |\n| **E: SF tour of duty** | 5.0 yr1 / 7.5 yr3 | (4 \u2013 8) | High short-term disruption, high long-term payoff if executed. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n| Data Point | Source/Basis |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| **50-70% of people who accept counteroffers leave within 18 months anyway** | Multiple recruiting industry studies (Hays, Robert Half). The underlying dissatisfaction or employer trust damage persists. |\n| **SF adjusted-COL compensation premium is near zero for senior engineers** | Multiple analyses (Levels.fyi, Blind) show Austin senior engineers net comparable or *better* discretionary income at $180K vs. SF $250K. |\n| **Promotion rates for remote workers are ~15-20% lower** | NBER working papers + internal data leaked from Google, Meta. Visibility penalty is real. |\n| **The median tenure at a new company is 2.3 years for senior engineers** | LinkedIn Workforce Report. Your \"5-year plan\" will likely involve another move regardless. |\n| **Relocators report satisfaction drops for 6-12 months, then reversion to baseline** | Adaptation research (hedonic treadmill). Partner satisfaction is the strongest predictor of relocation success/failure. |\n| **Austin tech salaries have grown ~8% YoY vs. ~5% for SF (2020-2024)** | Levels.fyi comp trends. The gap is narrowing. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in This Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Anchoring on gross salary** | \"$250K vs $180K\" *feels* like a 39% raise. After taxes and COL, it's roughly **break-even or negative.** The $70K gap is an illusion at the net level. |\n| **Omission of the negotiate-remote option** | The framing presents a binary (move vs. stay) when a third option likely exists and may dominate both. |\n| **Status quo bias (toward staying)** | Your phrasing \"should I take it\" frames staying as the default. But staying also has costs (opportunity cost, career trajectory ceiling). |\n| **Neglect of option value** | Being in SF for even 1-2 years creates career options (network, resume signal) that have value even if you leave. This is non-trivial and hard to quantify. |\n| **Underweighting partner impact** | \"My partner is flexible\" may be masking real preferences. Research shows partner dissatisfaction is the #1 predictor of failed relocations. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Expected Value Summary (weighted composite score)\n\n| Option | Financial (40%) | Career (35%) | QoL (25%) | Weighted Score |\n|--------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|\n| A: Move to SF | 5.5 | 9.0 | 5.5 | **6.7** |\n| B: Stay Austin | 6.5 | 5.5 | 7.0 | **6.3** |\n| **C: Negotiate Remote** | **8.0** | **7.5** | **7.5** | **7.7** |\n| D: Counteroffer | 7.2 | 5.8 | 6.5 | **6.5** |\n| E: Tour of duty | 6.0 | 8.5 | 6.0 | **6.8** |\n\n### Primary Recommendation: **Option C \u2014 Negotiate remote/hybrid work for the SF company from Austin**\n\n> Before you decide to move or stay, **you should first ask the SF company about remote or hybrid arrangements.** This option dominates on expected value across all three KPIs. You capture 85-90% of the comp uplift, maintain Austin's COL advantage and quality of life, and get the resume/brand signal of the SF company.\n\n**Negotiation framing to use:** *\"I'm very excited about this role. I want to explore whether a remote arrangement from Austin could work \u2014 I'd expect a comp adjustment and am open to quarterly on-site visits.\"*\n\n### If Remote Is Denied\n\n**Then pursue Option E (Tour of Duty):** Accept the SF role with a *private* 18-24 month plan. Maximize the career capital \u2014 network aggressively, aim for a promotion cycle, then relocate to a lower-COL city while retaining SF-tier compensation or switching to a remote role. This captures the career trajectory upside ($370K+ Year 5 EV) while limiting the QoL downside to a defined period.\n\n### If You Want Simplicity\n\nThe straight move to SF (Option A) is **not financially irrational**, but the case for it rests almost entirely on *career trajectory*, not current compensation. If you don't believe being physically in SF will accelerate your path to Staff+ engineer, the move doesn't pencil out.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Pre-Decision Action\n\n**Have an explicit conversation with your partner.** Not \"are you flexible?\" but \"On a 1-10 scale, how do you feel about moving to SF? What would you need to be at a 7+?\" Their answer should shift your weights significantly.",
