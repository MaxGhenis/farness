  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Not yet \u2014 but don't ignore the signal\n\nHere's how I'd think through this:\n\n## First, clarify what you actually know\n\nBefore spending $200K, I'd want honest answers to these questions:\n\n- **How many of your 200 customers are asking?** If it's 8 vocal ones, that's 4%. If it's 80, that's a different conversation.\n- **What specifically do they want to do on mobile?** There's a big difference between \"approve a request while I'm away from my desk\" and \"do everything the web app does.\"\n- **Has anyone churned or failed to close because of this?** Wanting something and it being a dealbreaker are very different.\n- **What's your current ARR and runway?** $200K might be a rounding error or it might be a quarter of your budget.\n\n## Why I'd lean against a native app right now\n\n**The math is tough at 200 customers.** That's $1,000 per customer to build, before ongoing maintenance costs (which people chronically underestimate \u2014 plan for 20-30% of build cost annually). You need to be confident this drives retention or expansion revenue that justifies it.\n\n**4 months is optimistic.** In my experience, this means 6-7 months realistically, and you'll ship v1 only to learn you built the wrong thing.\n\n**You have a cheaper option you haven't exhausted.** A responsive/PWA approach could get you 70% of the value at 20% of the cost.\n\n## What I'd do instead \u2014 in order\n\n1. **Talk to 10-15 of the customers asking for this.** Understand the actual workflows they want on mobile. Document the specific pain.\n2. **Invest 4-6 weeks in making your web app properly responsive.** Add to homescreen capability (PWA). This might satisfy most of the need.\n3. **Measure adoption of the mobile-optimized web app.** If people actually use it heavily on mobile, now you have real data.\n4. **If mobile usage is strong and you identify 2-3 killer use cases** that truly need native capabilities (push notifications, offline access, camera), then scope a focused native app around just those use cases \u2014 not a port of your whole product.\n\n## The exception \u2014 build it now if:\n\n- A few **large enterprise deals** are blocked by this requirement (and you've confirmed it in writing, not just from your sales team's interpretation)\n- You're in a market where **competitors already have apps** and it's becoming table stakes\n- Mobile is core to your value prop (field workers, on-the-go approvals, etc.) and you're clearly leaving money on the table\n\n## The honest bottom line\n\nMost B2B SaaS companies at 200 customers build native apps too early, spend too much, and end up with an app that 15% of users download and 5% use regularly. The companies that win with mobile apps are the ones that **deeply understand the mobile-specific use case first**.\n\nDon't let \"customers are asking for it\" substitute for that understanding. Customers ask for lots of things. Your job is to figure out what they actually need and what moves the business.\n\n**Start with the responsive web investment. Earn your way to the native app with data.**",
