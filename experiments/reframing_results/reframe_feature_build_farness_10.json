How many of the 200 customers? 10? 50? 150? This matters enormously. |\n| **Anchoring on the proposed solution** | The decision was framed as \"build native app: yes/no\" \u2014 collapsing a spectrum of options into a binary |\n| **IKEA effect / sunk-cost preview** | Once you frame $200K and 4 months, you start mentally \"owning\" the project and reasoning toward yes |\n| **Pro-innovation bias** | \"Mobile app\" feels modern and progressive; saying \"no\" feels like falling behind \u2014 even when the data doesn't support it |\n| **Neglect of opportunity cost** | $200K and 4 months of engineering time could be spent on features with higher NRR impact (integrations, workflows, reporting) |\n\n### Critical questions to pressure-test:\n- *What percentage of your 200 customers have explicitly requested this?*\n- *Have you lost any deals specifically because of no mobile app? How many?*\n- *What do users actually need to do on mobile?* (View dashboards? Full workflow? Approvals?)\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### \u27a1\ufe0f **Recommended: Option B (PWA) as an immediate step, with a gate to Option E (Hybrid) at 6 months**\n\n**Rationale by expected value:**\n\n| Option | E[24-month profit] | Risk-adjusted assessment |\n|--------|-------------------|------------------------|\n| A \u2013 Native | ~\u2212$16K | High cost, wide CI, negative median ROI |\n| **B \u2013 PWA** | **~$96K** | **Best risk-adjusted return; low regret in all scenarios** |\n| C \u2013 Responsive | ~$64K | Solid but lower upside |\n| D \u2013 Nothing | ~$0 | Acceptable short-term but competitive risk grows |\n| E \u2013 Hybrid | ~$30K | Reasonable but premature without usage data |\n\n### Staged plan:\n\n```\nMonth 0-2:    Ship PWA ($30-50K, 4-6 weeks)\nMonth 2-4:    Measure mobile usage, session depth, feature requests\nMonth 4-6:    If >30% WAU on mobile AND deal-loss data supports it \u2192\n              greenlight hybrid app (Option E)\n              If <15% WAU \u2192 you just saved $150K+ and validated the\n              say/do gap with real data\n```\n\n### Why NOT native now:\n- **Expected ROI is negative** at the point estimate\n- The 80% CI includes significant downside (\u221255%)\n- Base rates suggest only 25-35% chance of payback\n- You'd be spending **~15% of one year's implied revenue** (200 customers) on an unvalidated bet\n- A PWA gets you **real usage data** to de-risk the larger investment\n\n**The PWA is not the compromise \u2014 it's the rational first move that preserves optionality and maximizes information value per dollar spent.**",
