Let me think through it honestly with you, including the parts that are uncomfortable.\n\n## First, pressure-test the actual problem\n\nYou said \"engineering is our bottleneck \u2014 we can't ship fast enough.\" Before hiring a senior leader, make sure you've correctly diagnosed *why*.\n\n**Ask yourself honestly:**\n\n- Is it actually a management/process problem? (A VP Eng fixes this)\n- Is it a hiring problem \u2014 just not enough engineers? (A VP Eng helps, but slowly)\n- Is it a prioritization problem \u2014 building too many things at once? (That's a CEO/product problem, not an engineering leadership problem)\n- Is it a technical debt or architecture problem? (That's your CTO's domain, and freeing them up could help \u2014 *if* this is actually the issue)\n- Is it that your CTO is underperforming and you're avoiding that conversation? (A VP Eng hire becomes a political mess layered on top of a performance issue)\n\n**Be brutally honest about which of these it is.** Many founders hire a VP Eng when the real problem is that the CEO won't stop changing priorities every two weeks.\n\n## If the diagnosis genuinely points to \"CTO is doing two jobs\"\n\nThen yes, the split makes sense in principle. The classic model works:\n\n| Role | Focus |\n|---|---|\n| **CTO** | Architecture, technical vision, R&D, build vs. buy decisions |\n| **VP Engineering** | People management, delivery, process, hiring pipeline |\n\nThis is a real and valid separation at your stage.\n\n## But here's where startups get this wrong\n\n**1. Hiring too senior too fast**\nA \"VP Engineering\" from a 500-person company will likely be miserable and ineffective at a 15-person startup. You need someone who will still do hands-on work \u2014 run standups, unblock PRs, interview every candidate. Look for someone who has *scaled from* 15 to 50, not someone who *managed* 200.\n\n**2. The CTO relationship is everything**\nThis hire fails if your CTO feels undermined, or if the VP Eng and CTO can't agree on authority boundaries. Your CTO needs to be genuinely bought in \u2014 not just saying yes because they're drowning. Have a frank conversation about what they'd actually hand over and what they'd keep.\n\n**3. Expecting results too fast**\nA VP Eng won't speed up shipping for 3-6 months. Initially it gets *slower* \u2014 onboarding, relationship building, process changes. If your board is expecting immediate velocity improvement post-hire, set expectations now.\n\n**4. Skipping intermediate options**\nHave you considered:\n- Promoting a strong senior engineer to a team lead role first?\n- Hiring an engineering manager instead of a VP? (Lower risk, faster to hire, may be all you need at 15 people)\n- Getting the CTO a part-time chief of staff or technical project manager to handle coordination overhead?\n\nThese are cheaper, faster, lower-risk, and might solve 70% of the problem.\n\n## My honest recommendation\n\n**Here's what I'd actually do in your position:**\n\n1. **This week:** Have a structured conversation with your CTO. Map out where their time actually goes (hour by hour last two weeks). Identify what specifically they'd offload.\n\n2. **Short term (next 2-4 weeks):** Try a lightweight fix first \u2014 promote or hire an engineering manager or team lead. See if taking 60% of the management burden off the CTO is enough.\n\n3. **In parallel:** Start your VP Eng search, because it takes 3-5 months to hire a good one anyway. You'll either confirm you need them or realize you don't before you make an offer.\n\n4. **Non-negotiable:** Make your CTO a true partner in defining the role, interviewing candidates, and choosing the hire. If they're not enthusiastic about their top candidate, don't hire that person.\n\n## The bottom line\n\nThe instinct is right. The standard playbook works. But **the most expensive mistake isn't hiring too late \u2014 it's hiring the wrong senior leader into a problem you haven't clearly defined.** A bad VP Eng hire at your stage can cost you 6-12 months and multiple engineer departures.\n\nDiagnose first. Try the lighter-weight fix. Run the search in parallel. You'll end up in the right place.\n\nWhat's your gut on the actual root cause when you're being honest with yourself?",
