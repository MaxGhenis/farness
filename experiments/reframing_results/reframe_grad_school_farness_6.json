  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis: Farness Framework\n\n## 1. Explicit, Measurable KPIs\n\n| KPI | Definition | Time Horizon |\n|-----|-----------|--------------|\n| **NPV of Lifetime Earnings** | Present value of all future earnings (discount rate 5%) over 20 years | 20 years post-decision |\n| **Career Optionality Score** | Number of meaningfully distinct career paths accessible (roles, industries, functions) | 5 years post-decision |\n| **Risk-Adjusted Satisfaction** | Probability of being in a role you'd rate \u22658/10 on fulfillment | 5 years post-decision |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Options (Including Unmentioned)\n\n| # | Option |\n|---|--------|\n| A | **Attend MBA full-time (2 years)** |\n| B | **Stay in current role, pursue promotions** |\n| C | **Part-time / online MBA** (Georgia Tech, UT Austin \u2014 $30-50K total) |\n| D | **Skip MBA, pivot via self-study + targeted job search** (e.g., into PM, tech leadership) |\n| E | **Defer admission 1-2 years**, build savings and seniority, then attend |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Point Estimates and 80% Confidence Intervals\n\n### KPI 1: NPV of Incremental Lifetime Earnings (20 years, 5% discount rate)\n\nThe total cost of MBA \u2248 $160K tuition + $260K foregone salary (2 years) + ~$30K living expenses = **~$450K total cost**.\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A: Full-time MBA** | +$350K | (\u2212$100K to +$900K) |\n| **B: Stay & promote** | $0 (baseline) | (\u2212$200K to +$300K) |\n| **C: Part-time MBA** | +$200K | (+$50K to +$450K) |\n| **D: Self-directed pivot** | +$100K | (\u2212$150K to +$500K) |\n| **E: Defer 1-2 yrs** | +$450K | (\u2212$50K to +$1M) |\n\n**Key assumptions for A:** Post-MBA salary of ~$170-190K (median for \"good\" but non-M7 programs) vs. current trajectory reaching ~$180-200K as senior engineer in ~4-5 years anyway. The MBA advantage narrows significantly because **software engineering already has a high earnings trajectory**.\n\n### KPI 2: Career Optionality (distinct accessible paths, 5-year horizon)\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A: Full-time MBA** | 8 paths | (5 to 12) |\n| **B: Stay & promote** | 3 paths | (2 to 5) |\n| **C: Part-time MBA** | 6 paths | (4 to 8) |\n| **D: Self-directed pivot** | 4 paths | (2 to 6) |\n| **E: Defer then MBA** | 9 paths | (6 to 12) |\n\nMBA uniquely unlocks: management consulting, IB/PE, corporate strategy, brand management, VC, startup CEO (credentialed), CPO-track roles. This is the MBA's strongest value proposition.\n\n### KPI 3: P(Role Satisfaction \u2265 8/10) at Year 5\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI |\n|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **A: Full-time MBA** | 55% | (35% to 70%) |\n| **B: Stay & promote** | 40% | (25% to 60%) |\n| **C: Part-time MBA** | 45% | (30% to 60%) |\n| **D: Self-directed pivot** | 45% | (25% to 65%) |\n| **E: Defer then MBA** | 60% | (40% to 75%) |\n\n---\n\n## 4. Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n- **Median post-MBA salary (non-M7 \"good\" programs):** ~$150-175K total comp. At M7: ~$190-220K. *(GMAC 2023 Corporate Recruiters Survey)*\n- **Your current trajectory without MBA:** Senior SWE at 5-7 YOE \u2192 $180-250K at FAANG-tier; Staff-level \u2192 $300K+. **SWE is one of the few fields where MBA ROI is weakest** because the baseline is already high.\n- **MBA ROI for career switchers vs. accelerators:** Career switchers report higher satisfaction (72% \"worth it\") vs. those who return to similar roles (54%). *(Poets & Quants alumni surveys)*\n- **% of MBA grads who report the degree was \"worth it\" financially:** ~65-70% at top-20 programs; drops to ~50% outside top-20. *(FT, Bloomberg surveys)*\n- **Median time to recoup MBA investment for tech workers:** 7-10 years (vs. 3-5 years for those coming from lower-paying fields). *(Multiple analyses)*\n- **Program rank matters enormously:** The earnings premium for M7 (Harvard, Stanford, Wharton, etc.) is roughly **2x** the premium for rank 15-25 programs.\n\n**Critical question you haven't specified: Which program?** The difference between HSW and a rank-20 school is larger than the difference between going and not going.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Anchoring on prestige** | \"Good MBA program\" triggers status-seeking heuristic. You may be weighting brand over financial fundamentals. |\n| **Omission of the counterfactual** | The question frames it as \"MBA vs. stasis.\" Your actual counterfactual is a rapidly compounding SWE career \u2014 one of the highest-paid professions already. |\n| **Sunk cost of admission effort** | Having been admitted creates commitment pressure. The effort to apply feels like it should \"count.\" |\n| **Narrative bias / identity shift desire** | MBA is often sought when someone wants to *become a different kind of professional*, but the actual dissatisfaction may be solvable with a job change, not a degree. |\n| **Neglect of variance** | MBA outcomes are bimodal \u2014 some grads land $250K consulting/IB roles, many land $120-140K roles that are *below* your current comp. Averages mask this. |\n| **Opportunity cost blindness** | $450K total cost is abstract. That money compounding in index funds at 8% over 20 years = ~$2.1M. That's the real comparison. |\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommendation\n\n### The critical fork: **Do you want to leave software engineering?**\n\n**If NO (you want to stay in tech, maybe move to management):**\n\n> **Don't go. Expected value is negative.** Your SWE trajectory already matches or exceeds median MBA outcomes. Pursue engineering management or PM transitions internally. The confidence interval for Option A overlaps heavily with Option B, but Option B has no $450K downside cost. A part-time MBA (Option C) dominates if you want the credential.\n\n**If YES (you want consulting, finance, strategy, or a fundamentally different career):**\n\n> **Defer 1 year (Option E) if possible, then go \u2014 but ONLY if this is a top-15 program.** The expected value is positive (+$350-450K NPV) primarily through the *optionality* and *career switch* value. The deferral lets you save ~$130K more, reducing financial risk substantially.\n\n### Bottom Line Expected Value Table\n\n| Scenario | Best Option | EV of MBA (Option A) |\n|----------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Want to stay in tech | **B or C** | **Negative** (\u2212$50K to \u2212$200K) |\n| Want to switch careers, top-15 school | **E then A** | **Positive** (+$300K to +$500K) |\n| Want to switch careers, rank 20+ school | **D or C** | **Near zero** (\u00b1$100K) |\n\n**My single recommendation given information available:** Ask for a 1-year deferral. Use that year to (a) confirm you actually want to leave engineering by doing informational interviews in target MBA careers, and (b) save aggressively. If after that year you still want out of SWE, go. If not, decline and keep compounding your engineering career.",
