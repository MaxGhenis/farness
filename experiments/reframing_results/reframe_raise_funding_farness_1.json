Very safe. |\n| B: Wait 6 months | **72%** | [55%, 84%] | Must survive on 12\u21926 mo runway, then raise in unknown market. If raise fails, ~6 months to pivot to plan B. |\n| C: Small bridge | **80%** | [68%, 89%] | Extends to ~16 mo, still must raise full round eventually |\n| D: Reach profitability | **65%** | [45%, 78%] | At $500K MRR with 12 mo runway, requires aggressive cuts. Growth likely stalls. May kill the growth story. |\n| E: Negotiate current | **90%** | [82%, 95%] | Similar to A, slight delay risk from negotiation |\n\n### KPI 2 \u2014 Expected Founder Equity Retained After Next 2 Rounds\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A: Raise $20M now | **38%** | [30%, 45%] | ~10% dilution now, ~15-20% next round. Clean and predictable. |\n| B: Wait 6 months | **41%** | [0%, 52%] | Better valuation *if* it works. But 0% if company dies. **Expected value is dragged down by failure scenarios.** |\n| C: Small bridge | **37%** | [25%, 46%] | Bridge dilution + full round + next round = more total dilution events |\n| D: Reach profitability | **55%** | [0%, 70%] | No dilution if it works; 0% if growth stalls and company withers |\n| E: Negotiate current | **40%** | [32%, 47%] | Marginally better terms, similar trajectory |\n\n### KPI 3 \u2014 Expected Cash-on-Hand at Month 18\n\n| Option | Point Estimate | 80% CI | Reasoning |\n|--------|---------------|--------|-----------|\n| A: Raise $20M now | **$12M** | [$8M, $16M] | Assuming current burn rate ~$800K/mo scaling up |\n| B: Wait 6 months | **$10M** | [$0, $18M] | Higher if raise succeeds at bigger round; $0 if market turns |\n| C: Small bridge | **$5M** | [$1M, $10M] | Depends on timing of full raise |\n| D: Reach profitability | **$2M** | [$0, $5M] | Cash-constrained by design |\n| E: Negotiate current | **$11M** | [$7M, $15M] | Slightly less capital or similar |\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Relevant Base Rates (Outside View)\n\n**This is where the framing falls apart for Option B.**\n\n> **Base rate: VC market availability.** In any given 6-month window, there is roughly a **20-30% chance** the fundraising environment materially worsens (rate changes, banking crises, sentiment shifts). See: Q2 2022, Q3 2023, March 2020. Markets turned in *weeks*.\n\n> **Base rate: Startups that delay fundraising and die.** ~10-15% of startups with <12 months runway that choose to \"wait for a better valuation\" fail to raise at all (CB Insights, Carta data on bridge-to-nowhere dynamics).\n\n> **Base rate: Valuation step-up for 6 months of growth.** Startups growing 15% MoM that wait 6 months see a median valuation increase of ~1.5-2x. So $200M \u2192 $300-$400M is *plausible but not certain*.\n\n> **Base rate: Dilution difference.** The difference between raising at $200M and $300M on a $20M round is **10% vs 6.7% dilution \u2014 a 3.3 percentage point difference.** That's the actual stake of the \"wait\" strategy.\n\n> **Base rate: Founder regret.** In post-mortems, \"we should have raised when we could\" outnumbers \"we raised too early\" by roughly **3:1** in failed startup analyses.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Cognitive Biases in the Framing\n\n| Bias | How It Appears |\n|------|---------------|\n| **Anchoring on valuation** | The question frames this as \"$200M now vs. bigger number later\" \u2014 focusing on the *vanity metric* of valuation rather than the *outcome metric* of survival \u00d7 equity \u00d7 outcome. |\n| **Overconfidence in growth continuation** | 15% MoM is implicitly treated as a *reliable constant*. Base rate: most startups at this pace regress toward 5-8% MoM within 6 months. |\n| **Neglect of downside probability** | \"VCs are interested\" describes *current* sentiment. The question doesn't model what happens if interest evaporates. |\n| **Denominator neglect** | 3.3% less dilution *sounds* small. But framed as \"risk the entire company to save 3.3% equity,\" the risk-reward is stark. |\n| **Present bias (inverted)** | Normally we discount the future. Here, founders are *over-weighting* a hypothetical future valuation vs. certain present capital. This is anti-present bias \u2014 a form of greed-driven optimism. |\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Recommendation\n\n### Expected Value Calculation (Simplified)\n\nAssume ultimate exit value of company is **$V** (unknown, held constant across scenarios).\n\n| Option | E[Founder Equity] \u00d7 P[Survival] | Risk-Adjusted Outcome |\n|--------|--------------------------------|----------------------|\n| A: Raise now | 38% \u00d7 92% = **35.0%** | \u2705 **Best risk-adjusted** |\n| B: Wait 6 mo | 41% \u00d7 72% = **29.5%** | \u274c Worse despite higher equity if successful |\n| C: Bridge | 37% \u00d7 80% = **29.6%** | \u274c Complexity adds risk, little upside |\n| D: Profitability | 55% \u00d7 65% = **35.8%** | Comparable but *only if* you can actually do it, and kills growth narrative |\n| E: Negotiate | 40% \u00d7 90% = **36.0%** | \u2705 **Marginal improvement if feasible** |\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendation: Raise now (Option A), with a light attempt at Option E.**\n\n**Take the $20M.** Spend 1-2 weeks (no more) testing whether you can get $20M at $220-250M or $15M at $200M with better terms. If not, close at $200M immediately.\n\n**The core logic:**\n\n> You are contemplating risking a **92% survival probability** to chase **3.3 percentage points of dilution**. The expected value of waiting is *strictly lower* than raising now. The question is framed around valuation, but **the right frame is: \"Would you bet your company on a coin flip to save 3% equity?\"** The answer should be no.\n\n**The one exception:** If you have *concrete evidence* that growth is accelerating (not just continuing) and you can cut burn to extend runway to 18+ months without raising, Option B becomes more defensible. But \"VCs are interested\" is a *perishable asset* \u2014 act while it exists.",
