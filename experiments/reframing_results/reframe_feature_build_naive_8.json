Ask what specific tasks they're trying to do on mobile and when. Watch them use your current mobile web experience.\n\n2. **Optimize your web app for mobile** (4-6 weeks, maybe $30-50K). Responsive design, faster load times, key workflow simplification. This solves the problem for most B2B use cases.\n\n3. **Measure actual mobile usage** after optimization. If engagement is high and you're hitting browser limitations, now you have real evidence for a native app.\n\n---\n\n## When I'd change my answer to \"yes, build it\"\n\nI'd say build the native app **now** if any of these are true:\n\n- You need offline functionality, push notifications, or hardware access that browsers can't deliver well\n- You're losing significant deals to competitors who have apps\n- Your users are field workers who live on their phones (construction, logistics, field sales, healthcare)\n- You have the revenue where $200K is a small bet, not a big one\n\n---\n\n## The honest bottom line\n\nMost B2B companies at 200 customers who build native mobile apps end up with an expensive thing that 15% of users download and 5% use regularly. The companies where mobile apps are transformative are ones where the **use case is inherently mobile**, not where users say \"it'd be nice to have.\"\n\n**Optimize your mobile web first. Let the data tell you whether native is worth it.**\n\nThat said \u2014 I'm working with limited context. If you share more about your industry, user workflow, and revenue, I might land differently.",
