  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Framework\n\nThis is a significant decision, so let me help you think through it rigorously rather than give you a snap answer.\n\n## The Raw Financial Math\n\n**Costs (~$420K+ total):**\n- Tuition: $160K\n- Lost wages: ~$260K (2 years of salary)\n- Lost 401k contributions, equity vesting, etc.\n\n**Potential upside:**\n- Post-MBA salaries at top companies/consulting/finance often range $150K-$200K+ base, plus bonuses\n- But you're already at $130K, so the *incremental* gain is smaller than many MBA students experience\n\nThe financial breakeven alone is often **7-10 years**, and that assumes the salary bump wouldn't have happened anyway through normal career growth.\n\n## The Questions That Actually Matter\n\nThe financial math alone doesn't answer this. You need to honestly answer:\n\n**1. What do you want the MBA *for*?**\n- Career switch to consulting, finance, or product management? \u2192 Stronger case\n- \"I want to make more money as an engineer\" \u2192 Weak case; the MBA isn't the efficient path\n- Start a company eventually? \u2192 Debatable; some say just go start it\n\n**2. Could you get where you want without it?**\n- Many tech companies promote engineers to leadership without MBAs\n- PM roles increasingly hire from engineering directly\n\n**3. Which program specifically?**\n- Top 10 (M7 especially) \u2192 The network and brand genuinely open doors\n- Ranked 15-30 \u2192 Much harder to justify the math\n- You said \"good\" \u2014 where it falls matters enormously\n\n**4. What's your trajectory right now?**\n- At $130K with 3 years, you're likely to hit $180-250K+ as a senior/staff engineer in 5-7 years anyway, *with no tuition cost*\n\n## My Honest Take\n\n**I'd lean toward \"don't go\" UNLESS:**\n\n- \u2705 You have a clear career goal that specifically requires an MBA (banking, consulting, certain corporate leadership tracks)\n- \u2705 It's a top ~10 program where the network alone is worth something\n- \u2705 You've genuinely hit a ceiling or hate engineering and want a fundamentally different career\n- \u2705 You value the experience beyond pure ROI (and can afford to)\n\n**The case against is strong if:**\n- \u274c You're going because it feels like \"the next step\" or for prestige\n- \u274c You'd take on heavy debt\n- \u274c You like engineering and just want more money or seniority\n\nSoftware engineering is one of the few fields where the MBA ROI is *weakest*, because your earning potential is already high and grows steeply without the degree.\n\n## What I'd Actually Recommend\n\nBefore committing, try to **talk to 5-10 people** who were software engineers, got MBAs from this specific program, and are now 5+ years out. Ask them honestly if they'd do it again. The answers will vary \u2014 and the *pattern* will tell you a lot.\n\nWhat's driving your interest in the MBA? That would help me give you sharper advice.",
