  "response_text": "# MBA Decision Analysis\n\nThis is a significant decision, so let me work through it honestly rather than just cheerleading.\n\n## The Financial Reality\n\n**Direct costs:**\n- Tuition: ~$160K\n- Lost income: ~$260K (2 years of salary)\n- **Total real cost: ~$420K+** (before living expenses)\n\nThat's a number worth sitting with.\n\n## The Key Question You Need to Answer\n\n**What do you want the MBA *for*?** This is where the analysis completely changes.\n\n### The MBA likely makes sense if:\n- You want to transition into **product management, consulting, or finance** where the MBA is a genuine credential gate\n- You want a specific leadership/GM track at a large company\n- The network and recruiting pipeline of *this specific program* places people into roles paying $180-250K+ post-graduation\n- You've hit a ceiling that skills alone won't break through\n\n### The MBA likely does NOT make sense if:\n- You want to stay in engineering (a staff/senior engineer path gets you to $200-400K without the $420K hole)\n- Your primary motivation is \"career acceleration\" without a specific target\n- You're going partly because it feels prestigious or safe\n- You haven't talked to actual alumni about outcomes\n\n## What Concerns Me About Your Situation\n\n**Software engineers are in a unique position** where the MBA ROI is often *worse* than for other careers because:\n- Your earning trajectory is already strong\n- Tech companies promote engineers without MBAs\n- $130K at 3 years means you'll likely be at $180-250K in a few more years anyway, without spending $420K\n\n## My Honest Recommendation\n\n**Don't go yet.** Instead, do this first:\n\n1. **Define the specific role** you want post-MBA (title, company type, function)\n2. **Check if you actually need the MBA** to get that role \u2014 talk to 5+ people in that role and ask about their path\n3. **Look at the program's employment report** \u2014 what % land in your target role, and at what compensation?\n4. **Run the breakeven math** \u2014 in many scenarios, it takes 8-12 years to recover the cost vs. staying in engineering\n\nIf after doing that homework the MBA still clearly opens a door you can't open otherwise, then go. But \"good program + good career\" doesn't automatically equal \"good decision.\" The fit with your *specific goals* is everything.\n\n**What role are you actually hoping the MBA leads to?** That would help me give you sharper advice.",
