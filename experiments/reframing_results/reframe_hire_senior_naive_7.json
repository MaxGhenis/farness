  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Probably yes, but slow down before you pull the trigger.\n\nThis is one of the most common \u2014 and most commonly *botched* \u2014 moves at the Series A stage. Here's how I'd think through it honestly.\n\n---\n\n## First, diagnose the real problem\n\n\"We can't ship fast enough\" has multiple possible root causes, and a VP of Engineering only solves some of them.\n\n**Ask yourself which of these is actually true:**\n\n- **Your CTO is spending 60%+ of their time on people management, process, and hiring** instead of technical work \u2192 VP Eng is likely the right call\n- **Your CTO is deep in code but making architectural choices that create drag** (too much complexity, rewriting things, not delegating) \u2192 A VP Eng won't fix this; the CTO needs coaching or a different role\n- **You don't have enough engineers** \u2192 You need a strong hiring manager, which *could* be a VP Eng, but a recruiting push might come first\n- **Scope and priorities are unclear, so engineers build the wrong things** \u2192 That's a product/leadership problem, not an engineering management one\n\nBe honest about which of these you're actually facing. Most founders jump to \"hire a VP Eng\" when the bottleneck is sometimes themselves.\n\n---\n\n## If the diagnosis confirms you need a VP Eng, here's what I'd flag:\n\n### The case *for* it\n- A CTO who's great at architecture but drowning in 1:1s, sprint planning, and hiring coordination is a *wasted asset* at your stage\n- At 15 people you're right at the threshold where informal coordination starts breaking down\n- Post-Series A, your investors expect acceleration \u2014 you need someone who can build the team to 25-40\n\n### The real risks nobody warns you about\n\n1. **CTO/VP Eng misalignment is poisonous.** If their responsibilities aren't crystal clear, you'll get turf wars, confused reports, and your best engineers will leave. You need to define the split *before* you hire.\n\n2. **You might hire too senior.** A VP Eng who managed 100 engineers at Google will be miserable and ineffective managing 8. You probably need someone who *wants* to build a team from 10\u219240, not someone who's \"done it before at scale.\"\n\n3. **Your CTO might resist it.** Even if they say they want it, having someone else manage \"their\" team is an identity shift. Have a real conversation \u2014 not a hopeful one.\n\n4. **It takes 6+ months to see results.** This won't fix your shipping speed next quarter. You need a bridge plan.\n\n---\n\n## What I'd actually do, in order\n\n**Step 1 \u2014 This week:** Have a brutally honest conversation with your CTO. Ask them: *\"If you could only do one part of your current job, which would it be?\"* Their answer tells you a lot.\n\n**Step 2 \u2014 Short-term fix (now):** Promote or empower a senior engineer as a team lead to take some management load off the CTO immediately. This is cheap, fast, and tests whether the problem is really management bandwidth.\n\n**Step 3 \u2014 Start the VP Eng search, but be patient.** This hire is one of the highest-leverage and highest-risk hires you'll make. A bad VP Eng at a 15-person company can drive out your best people in 90 days. Budget 2-3 months and involve your CTO deeply in the process.\n\n**Step 4 \u2014 Define the split in writing.** Before the VP Eng starts, publish internally who owns what. Something like:\n- **CTO:** Technical vision, architecture decisions, build-vs-buy, technical diligence\n- **VP Eng:** Team building, delivery process, engineering culture, execution velocity\n\n---\n\n## The honest bottom line\n\nThe instinct is probably right. But the framing \u2014 *\"hire a VP Eng so the CTO can focus on architecture\"* \u2014 is subtly dangerous because it assumes the CTO is the architect you need and that management is the bottleneck. Validate both assumptions before you commit to a $250-350K hire that reshapes your entire engineering culture.\n\n**What does your CTO actually say when you ask them what's in the way?** That answer matters more than any framework I can give you.",
