  "response_text": "# My Recommendation: Probably yes, but slow down before you pull the trigger.\n\nThis is one of the most common and most consequential decisions at your stage. Here's how I'd think through it honestly.\n\n## The core problem might not be what you think it is\n\nBefore hiring a VP of Engineering, you need to diagnose *why* you can't ship fast enough. \"Engineering is our bottleneck\" can mean very different things:\n\n- **People management is consuming the CTO's time** \u2192 VP Eng probably right\n- **Technical debt / poor architecture is slowing everything down** \u2192 VP Eng won't fix this\n- **Unclear product requirements causing churn** \u2192 This is a product/leadership problem\n- **You actually just need 3 more senior engineers** \u2192 Cheaper, faster solution\n- **Your CTO is underperforming** \u2192 VP Eng becomes a political nightmare\n\n**Be honest with yourself about which of these is actually true.** Talk to your engineers individually. The answer might surprise you.\n\n## If it really is a management bandwidth problem, then yes \u2014 but with caveats\n\n**Reasons this can work well:**\n- A strong VP Eng handles hiring pipeline, sprint processes, 1:1s, cross-team coordination\n- Frees CTO for technical vision, architecture decisions, and hard technical problems\n- Brings operational discipline that most founder-CTOs haven't built before\n- At 15 people heading toward 30+, this is roughly the right inflection point\n\n**Reasons this frequently goes wrong:**\n\n1. **The CTO says they want this but actually doesn't.** Many CTOs feel threatened and subtly undermine the VP Eng. Have a brutally honest conversation about what the CTO's role becomes.\n\n2. **You hire too senior or too junior.** Too senior and they'll want to change everything and clash with the CTO. Too junior and they're just a team lead with an inflated title.\n\n3. **The role is undefined.** \"CTO does architecture, VP Eng does management\" sounds clean on paper. In practice, the boundaries are messy. Write down specific decisions each person owns *before* you hire.\n\n4. **It takes 6+ months to work.** A VP Eng needs to build trust with the existing team, learn the codebase and culture, and then change processes. If you're expecting faster shipping in 60 days, you'll be disappointed.\n\n## What I'd actually do in your position\n\n**Step 1 (This week):** Talk to your engineers. Ask them what's slowing them down. Don't assume you know.\n\n**Step 2 (Parallel):** Have a candid conversation with your CTO. Ask: *\"If you could hand off any parts of your job, what would they be? What would you never want to hand off?\"* Listen carefully to what they resist.\n\n**Step 3 (Decide):** If the diagnosis confirms it's a management bandwidth problem:\n- Consider whether a **senior engineering manager** (not VP-level) might solve 80% of the problem at lower cost, lower risk, and faster hiring\n- If you do hire VP Eng, make your CTO the primary decision-maker in that hire \u2014 they have to *want* this person\n\n**Step 4 (Don't skip):** Simultaneously fix whatever you can right now. Better processes, cut scope, cancel low-value projects. A hire 3-4 months from now doesn't help your current sprint.\n\n## The honest uncomfortable bit\n\nSometimes when a CEO says \"engineering is our bottleneck,\" what's actually happening is that the company is trying to do too many things and no amount of engineering capacity will fix a prioritization problem. \n\nIf your engineers are working on 6 different initiatives for 15 people, you don't need a VP of Engineering. You need to kill 4 of those initiatives.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** The instinct is probably directionally right. But hire for the problem you've actually diagnosed, not the problem you've assumed. And make sure your CTO genuinely wants a partner, not just says they do because they're exhausted.",
