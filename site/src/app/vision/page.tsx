            builds open AI forecasters. We make them predict consequential

            <h2>The bet</h2>
            <p>
              Open source software opened code. Open data opened the inputs.
              Open weights opened the reasoning machinery. We open the
              predictions: continuously-updated forecasts from AI systems whose
              tool calls, assumptions, uncertainty, calibration, and later
              outcomes are public.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use forecasting as an alignment pressure. A system that must
              predict public facts before they happen has to track reality,
              expose uncertainty, use evidence, and learn from misses. When the
              trace is open, the public can inspect the model's evidence and the
              model can learn from the public record of its own errors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The traces create a compounding loop. Aggregate them and
              systematic biases become visible. Score the forecasts and weak
              methods lose credibility. Publish the fixes and the next
              generation of forecasters starts from a better baseline. Applied
              to prediction, the open-source dynamic becomes epistemic
              infrastructure.

            <h2>What we build</h2>
            <p>
              Farness Foundation builds four connected pieces of public-good
              forecasting infrastructure:
            </p>
            <h3>We run open forecasters on consequential questions</h3>
            <p>
              We run AI-agent ensembles across the structured grid of
              consequential questions: government statistics from BEA, BLS,
              Census, and IRS; policy parameters encoded by Axiom; and
              counterfactual questions that drive policy and economic decisions.
              We publish the forecasts, the traces, the calibration history, and
              the running methodology notes openly. Funded compute scales the
              depth of the ensemble; the substrate stays free at the point of
              use.
            </p>
            <h3>We simulate policy with inspectable models</h3>
            <p>
              We maintain PolicyEngine as open-source microsimulation for US,
              UK, and Canadian tax-benefit systems. Governments, think tanks,
              advocacy organizations, and researchers use it for custom policy
              analysis. Farness forecasters call PolicyEngine when they need
              policy-conditional distributions, and PolicyEngine keeps serving
              the policy community through the brand and workflows people
              already know.
            </p>
            <h3>We build calibrated synthetic populations</h3>
            <p>
              We build Microplex as the synthetic micro-data substrate for
              PolicyEngine simulations and calibration-native AI research. We
              publish the population data, methodology, and synthesizer code
              openly. Microplex replaces PolicyEngine's Enhanced CPS substrate
              with data calibrated more tightly to administrative benchmarks and
              useful beyond tax-benefit microsimulation.
            </p>
            <h3>We make everyday agent advice forecastable</h3>
            <p>
              We maintain the open-source Farness Decisions package, CLI, MCP
              server, and agent skills. They turn advice-seeking into explicit
              forecasts with KPIs, options, confidence intervals, resolution
              rules, and calibration tracking. This keeps the same discipline
              available for individual decisions, team decisions, and public
              policy forecasts.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>The transparency advantage is the durable moat</h2>
            <p>
              We make transparency the core mechanism. Every methodology
              improvement, newly-discovered bias, and successful tool
              integration becomes shared infrastructure. Researchers can inspect
              the trace, reproduce the forecast, challenge the assumptions, and
              contribute a better method. Each improvement raises the baseline
              for everyone who builds on the substrate.
            </p>
            <p>
              The same dynamic that made Linux durable protects Farness's
              position. The compounding work happens across the whole community
              of users and contributors. The foundation maintains the core
              infrastructure, integrates the best contributions, sets direction,
              and protects the public-good character. The community expands the
              surface area faster than any single organization could.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>Built for the agents of tomorrow</h2>
            <p>
              The infrastructure that matters most gets built ahead of the
              capability that needs it. TCP/IP was designed for a few hundred
              nodes and scaled to billions because the design anticipated future
              use. Kubernetes solved orchestration problems most organizations
              had not yet reached when it shipped. Linux was built when
              computing was tiny and scaled with hardware nobody had imagined.
              Substrate-builders capture disproportionate value because they are
              already there when the demand shows up.
            </p>
            <p>
              Farness is built with this in mind. Every capability is reachable
              through a clean machine-callable API; future agents will call
              tools directly. Every agent trace is structured for downstream
              consumption by other agents and human readers. Every tool in the
              simulation engine is self-describing so that agents that have not
              been invented yet can discover what is available. Permissioning
              anticipates millions of automated participants through scoped
              automated access. Calibration scoring is queryable, so current
              agents can learn from history and future agents can preferentially
              route to tool configurations with proven track records.
            </p>
            <p>
              This costs a little more today and pays disproportionately when
              capability arrives. By the time agents are reliably orchestrating
              tools, composing pipelines, and proposing methodology
              improvements, the substrate they need will already be open,
              public, free, and continuously calibrated. Open substrate gives
              tomorrow's agents permission-less infrastructure the next decade
              of AI development can build on.

            <h2>The stack</h2>
            <p>
              Two independent 501(c)(3) foundations, technically integrated as
              one open stack:

                published government statistics to the laws that mandate them.
                Ballmer-funded. Separate organization, shared substrate.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Farness Foundation</strong> — open-predictions platform,
                microsimulation engine and custom policy analysis
                (PolicyEngine), synthetic-population substrate (Microplex),
                personal decision tool (Farness Decisions), and the research
                program on calibration-native foundation models and value
                forecasting.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              The Farness platform consumes Axiom (encoded law and government
              data architecture) and Microplex (population substrate) as inputs,
              runs ensembles through PolicyEngine and other computational
              engines, and publishes calibrated forecasts. Policy partners
              interact with PolicyEngine directly through its own brand and
              channels. New audiences — AI safety, agencies funding their own
              forecasts, prediction-market researchers, broader policy analysts
              — interact with Farness as the umbrella platform.

            <h2>Open predictions as a movement</h2>
            <p>
              The category needs a name to anchor its identity. The lineage:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Open source software</strong> opened the code. Linux,
                Apache, Mozilla. The free software movement and its successors
                made source available and rewrote the economics of software
                distribution.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open data</strong> opened the inputs. Wikipedia, Common
                Crawl, OpenStreetMap, government open-data portals. The raw
                material of analysis became public and citable.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open weights</strong> opened the reasoning machinery.
                Allen Institute's Olmo, Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek. The trained
                models themselves became available for inspection and reuse.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Open predictions</strong> opens the reasoning
                <em>itself</em>, on consequential questions. Every prior, every
                tool call, every update is auditable. The output includes the
                forecast and the full chain of reasoning that produced it.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each step opens more of the epistemic process. Each step produces
              durable public goods and gives the next generation of builders
              more to start from. Open predictions is the natural next layer,
              and Farness is the foundation building it.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2>We align AI by making it predict</h2>
            <p>
              We give AI systems a narrow job with a hard feedback loop: predict
              consequential outcomes before they happen, explain the evidence
              behind the prediction, quantify uncertainty, and accept a public
              score when reality arrives. That objective pushes models toward
              truth-tracking behavior because calibration, evidence use, and
              humility become measurable product requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use the strongest available models as forecasters today. We
              connect them to public data, Axiom-encoded law, PolicyEngine
              simulations, Microplex populations, and explicit calibration
              records. We evaluate which model-tool-method combinations predict
              best. We publish the traces so other researchers can reproduce,
              criticize, and improve the methods.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the corpus grows, we train and evaluate prediction-native
              systems: agents that select tools, decompose questions, maintain
              uncertainty, update on evidence, and learn from scored outcomes.
              The lab advances by making forecasts useful in the world and by
              making the full learning loop open.

            <h2>What success looks like in five years</h2>
            <p>
              At maturity, Farness produces continuously-updated calibrated
              forecasts on every consequential government statistic, every
              encoded policy parameter, and every counterfactual conditional
              question stakeholders care about. The platform runs hundreds to
              thousands of specialized agent configurations, each with published
              methodology and visible track record. Calibration history goes
              back years and is queryable per question, per configuration, per
              resolution period. Government agencies fund targeted compute on
              their projection questions. Researchers build on the open
              infrastructure for their own work. Frontier AI labs use the
              calibration corpus as a training and evaluation resource.
              Open-source forecaster configurations and tool integrations are
              contributed by people the foundation has never met.
            </p>
            <p>
              The forecasts feed into the decisions of governments, advocacy
              organizations, firms, and individuals because calibrated
              probability distributions with visible evidence improve the
              decisions those institutions already make. The substrate
              compounds: every new tool integration, every new methodology
              insight, and every new question coverage makes everything that was
              already there more useful.
            </p>
            <p>
              And when the AI agents of 2030 arrive — substantially more capable
              than today's, better at tool selection, better at composing
              methodology, better at reasoning over their own outputs — they
              find a substrate already built for them. Open, calibrated,
              audit-trail-native, and free at the point of use. The capability
              becomes immediately deployable on consequential questions because
              the infrastructure is already there.

              generate model code, but autonomous improvement of methodology
              without sustained human guidance is years out. Honest framing:
              open human-in-the-loop improvement of AI ensembles on a
              transparent substrate, with the substrate compounding the
              human-and-AI work over time. We build collaborative compounding
              before autonomous self-improvement.

              <strong>The one-year launch starts narrower.</strong> The platform
              launches with a smaller agent ensemble, fewer questions, a
              narrower research program, and a working but incomplete substrate.
              Building toward the mature state takes real research and
              engineering investment over years. The vision is the north star;
              the early stages look more like a focused shipping organization
              than a complete forecasting layer.

              <strong>Open infrastructure depends on adoption.</strong>{" "}
              Organizations need workflows that integrate open predictions into
              real decisions. Building that institutional muscle across policy
              shops, agencies, and other users takes years. Farness can lead the
              category and still has to earn adoption one workflow at a time.

                Regulatory ambiguity if forecasts become market-moving.
              </strong>{" "}
              Farness publishes forecasts rather than trades, which avoids most
              prediction-market regulatory complexity. If open forecasts become
              widely consumed by financial markets, the SEC or CFTC may still
              take interest in disclosure rules. Probably solvable through
              precedents like Federal Reserve forecast publication, but warrants
              real legal review.

              <strong>The PolicyEngine brand transition.</strong> PolicyEngine
              continues operationally unchanged, but funders, board, and
              partners need to be brought along on the umbrella structure.
              Existing grants are to PolicyEngine via PSL Foundation fiscal
              sponsorship; the cleanest path is incorporating Farness Foundation
              as the new 501(c)(3) and graduating PolicyEngine into it from PSL.
              Donor consent process is straightforward; the communications work
              requires care.

                The "Farness" name has multiple uses to disambiguate.

              Farness Foundation (the org), Farness (the open-predictions
              platform — the flagship), Farness Decisions (the personal decision
              tool). Naming hierarchy needs to be settled before any public
              launch.
